now , why does this matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a graph of the dolphins in the lancet bay .
and i remember , as i sat on my desk , and i thought , &quot; well , i know it . what a great scientific discovery . &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re always going to be closed around the world and more often from the same reason , and i think that should be a little bit of the time .
and at the beginning , i showed you how strong we have the ecosystem of monterey bay , through pollution and the most related problems .
and the most powerful -- the most powerful --
about the same time , he asked his mother , &quot; you know the book of michael &apos;s book ? that &apos;s the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; ?
we really had fear .
craig here moves the head .
you saw the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
it &apos;s been our modern way of thinking about the benefits , but i think we should also recognize what price .
clay shirky , this great computer system of all the mesh , has the premise that &apos;s going to be asked here on the top of this wonderful way .
now , there are so many new foundations that are the most powerful and investment , which people bring together , together for a goal , in a larger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful because not only philanthropy is being created . other big parts of social health and business is asking hard to make the business as usual .
i forbid this photograph near me . it &apos;s in my office , because i always felt a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never learned both .
my own research to mobile phones and the most powerful shows that 80 percent of all calls are actually going to go four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , you &apos;re going to be able to get together .
and with the modern bureaucracy , a very rational approach , where there was a clear separation between the private environment and the public environment .
we &apos;re worried that texting , texting , facebook , the most intact intimacy , is showing the way the most profound of the brain can promote the deep relationship to the way that the most profound relationships can be able to convey to the way that we can
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is how we believe the first autonomous , the world &apos;s first autonomous world .
for example , the brain &apos;s brain tends to generate a lot of the alpha of the user .
no challenging task .
and at the time , a little bit of a $ $ 60,000 of 60,000 in the year is to send a human to jail .
their family has been living for eight generations in a city called the west , west virginia .
yes .
we can create these local markets and incentives to use the materials as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all should invest in it .
and he would sometimes won , you don &apos;t believe it , on a computer factory in los angeles -- a reason , l.a. to love -- at the time .
i started my company to help communities all over the country to use their existing potential to improve the entire quality of life .
and before you don &apos;t have kids , you &apos;re not going to understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are starting to discover in adulthood in adulthood .
it always takes time .
true guilt is just made of a person , and someone with syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to the people , it &apos;s not far far .
but i found that i &apos;ve been born the kids i &apos;ve born , so love i &apos;m going to be a life without you .
he wouldn &apos;t get out of his legs right .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve had a lot of luck .
it &apos;s about two weeks old , and there are it .
this is the beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- the one that &apos;s now here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and has built school , just as she was connected to internet .
think about it -- because there &apos;s other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin is pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a sense of making sure not to integrate more , more of the prices in the bottom .
for a computer company , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of the world &apos;s issues .
and to talk about a cliff , i was told to be a lot of time , although i don &apos;t know what party that is supporting or attack .
wealth is going to be a little bit of time that you shouldn &apos;t call a more powerful .
and there &apos;s a lot of the time to control there .
no one &apos;s important theories was a full success .
we have fear that the world looked at .
and as a lot of these work , we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it &apos;s happening here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see her faces very precisely .
this is not a expression of joy .
this lady is actually a particularly special face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s going to be a light of light , if you move , so it gets a little bit of a object , although it &apos;s silent -- just just like brilliant that &apos;s made by the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only about a millimeter .
and that one , which i showed you before , was a very complex .
it wins or lose in this moment .
the emotional band between this object and you &apos;re going to form it , is a computer company that happens before you think about it at all .
i don &apos;t think we need to make this choice .
it &apos;s also a thought that we forgot .
i think it takes to return to the tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think that &apos;s how we think .
and at the end of the world &apos;s end , they &apos;re all on and say , &quot; thank you plato , thank you , thank you , thank jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t explain that artists shouldn &apos;t tell their motives , because if they were calling them , they destroyed the magic and we might have found it .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do it .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people say , &quot; is there not something that is bigger than we all , else else ? &quot;
because you agree to 90 percent because you have a similar view of so many things , and you &apos;re polite to the point of other opinion .
so he led me from places like chile -- the most popular desert in chile -- after siberia , in underground mines , in the japanese alps , in north america , to antarctica , until antarctica and even the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake of the world . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be extraordinary for that .
this hut was built by robert &apos;s scott , and his men built when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
remember , these whole wiring are doing people in extreme cold , in the plastic temperature .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up on this .
what people are doing first is book , which you can look for in the book , and that makes fun .
it was pretty many people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents a page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s exactly what borrow is exactly .
a day hand , about two or three teas .
with 15 dollars an hour , and about 100 to 150 dollars an hour , we can make material very much online , and we have a lot of the net .
the question is : is this the world that we want to live in ?
flowers are going to come up with the gulf .
we all know that the earth has problems .
after the form of spores , they were in .
if you go through the landscape , it &apos;s going to be high in your shoes and tries to respond to the floor .
across all the dirt through all the dirt .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a extraordinary rare .
i did something else that nobody would have done .
the box of life -- they get a dvd from the ted conference -- they give earth and water , and they have both of them and they have both of them and they have both of them and the other , as spores , like the fates .
i &apos;ve lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : is life adaptive enough ?
i &apos;ve been eating somehow myself .
and the doctor studied us to make sure whether it was really good .
and all they went to me .
and the part of ethiopia , one part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are amazing and incredibly , incredibly , and i have no idea how people do it , to live there .
this beautiful picture , this beautiful picture , is the amazon .
this is actually a computer company .
i had to think about how to put it and cut it , but also how to pick the right person to get the right person in a computer factory .
you set up the kind of blood , you took blood off , you &apos;re looking at blood , looked at the microscope , put the culture on , it &apos;s the culture of the world .
but we need a computer pit , pit pit for patients .
and so the medicine is sometimes feeling .
we looked at the street for the riots , we looked at the most powerful , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have something else , they have checklists .
and it &apos;s just hard .
so these are really immensely many bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and that &apos;s what they could keep the losses smaller .
they take their crayons and they &apos;re going to take their families to twice twice in the year .
honeybees are in minority .
let &apos;s take a cave in new york with a 15,000 of 15,000 bats , now it &apos;s 1,000 . that &apos;s as a number of san francisco in three years , the population of half the world &apos;s population .
but now , not all of us have a little bit of the time , or lawn that we can turn , and so you can always get a meadow in a single way of being in a $ violent .
and i whistled at the holy night at the family of my wife .
and to defend my title -- like the other athlete and other athletes do that -- i thought i &apos;m going to go back to 2005 , and i won again .
that &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the largest living creature on our planet , is wrong , completely wrong .
while the night they roll their leaves and reduce the movement , and while the leaves will be open -- there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters on one of his friends , and he &apos;s a little bit of a friend of the president , and the president of the royal society , so the largest scientific authority in britain , which he talked about from a computer company
and the human being only inspired by people or the animals , if he made a robot .
you don &apos;t know that she &apos;s filmed .
and then when it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh about .
i was inspired by it .
this is again in 2005 .
they got two of my boys who had hidden cameras in the hidden cameras .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a computer company to see a stadium in a stadium .
the idea is still in the beginning , but it looks like this .
this is ted .
and this is the wine that i want to break .
well , kids don &apos;t have the most powerful case , they &apos;re a special case .
they &apos;re kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic of the world .
the discovery of the world &apos;s relationship is great , incredibly awesome .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this kind of thing .
the ant is not alone .
they just heard this man .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
now maybe we should take it to the seriousness .
it &apos;s the devil of talking . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , every one of them is a single chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , it tries to listen to the most powerful and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with the headphones is the deafness -- the saddle-shaped .
and it &apos;s a wonderful way of doing it .
i &apos;m going to leave you with a little bit of a time , that it &apos;s very good for you .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what &apos;s in the middle .
you look at this direction , so i &apos;ll close it here .
we thought that guy was the materials .
it &apos;s a lot of seven billion of the people who are all of their own passion , and all of them as part of a little bit of a sudden and creating these world -- in their own , in their own and their kitchens .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even if you &apos;re invisible . the reason that you &apos;re playing on space-time like a drum .
but our sun is not going to end as black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black hole , but black holes can hear you also , even though they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how that will sound .
it &apos;s also supposed to be a mission for space that hopefully will start in the next 10 years , and it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;ve been doing a little bit more .
trees represent a standstill .
that &apos;s what i think i &apos;m doing .
we are critical to the west , the view of the west , which is our identity -- the image , what &apos;s going to be drawn from us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was completely ideological and i didn &apos;t get more of the time .
that iran once was a secular society , and we had a democracy , and that these democracy of the american government was stolen and from the british government .
i &apos;m standing here to say that the iranian women have found a new voice , and they have my voice .
on this self , a size should be a wholeness , a wholeness .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami has right .
they learn swimming through swimming . they &apos;re going to drive wheel through wheel .
the fossil of this animal will only find in the south america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you just see this video . if you &apos;re bored , you just go on .
but i was thrilled and i kept doing it .
khan academy videos are also there .
this is the moving and reflect from functions .
red means they &apos;re going to be a lot of the time .
a lot of the efforts of the classroom is focused on the classroom to teachers , &quot; students to teachers . &quot;
and the collaboration that they had with los altos , how did they come from ?
is it ready for the big toss ?
a few months ago , i got a call from a computer company where i work .
but it &apos;s always silent , like a silent silent . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his favorite school was visited him , he said , &quot; and who are these things that are young men ? &quot;
and then , if you were standing , the young one was going down , and the young , 30 feet tall , and disappeared .
these properties of a dialogue is not in these kinds of things .
there &apos;s a domain in the grim part of this fusiform , which represents the teeth and the eyes , and this part of the fusiform is active when people have the most sophisticated hallucinations .
&quot; kermit doesn &apos;t mean anything . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have a lot of images of this in my favorite .
edith widder : i made these pictures with a special camera whose sensitivity of the darkness is very polite to the darkness of the darkness .
for example , these crab for example , the kind of bioluminescent material material in the water , just like a squid or octopus creates a cloud of a cloud .
this is what a plant looks like , actually , but a animal .
there &apos;s something little that react to it .
it should attack the hunters of the brain .
one approach would be to draw a picture .
if we get the double double to your two strands , you see that these things like teeth look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged and it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
one is to be a finite .
again , these are all the things that are all the scientific science , scientific design .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to put concepts intuitively with images of objects and processes .
if the most thin place is very thin , you can be able to be able to be able to be the same thing and hard work to the world .
i &apos;m here to commit them to support us , to help us change the way people and other creatures are doing things .
and not by the most powerful , but it &apos;s not allowed by collective action , which is coming from literacy .
the other big narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of his suppliers , treated the other thing , treated these as a network and training them to produce better , even though they &apos;re train them , better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , everything about frostbite and trouble are running and the physical , cold conditions .
first of all , we &apos;ve developed a little experiment where we put people in the people , and they asked them to build something .
and if you said , we gave them a new one , and while they have this kind of thing , we have the other thing that they &apos;ve just built , again , again .
there was a very beautiful relationship between love and the number of the building legos .
and i think the ceo of the ceo is basically not understood how important meaning is .
but i should point out that by the way , the way that people could cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think of children .
and i think in the industrial revolution adam smith was real than karl marx , but really , we have a lot of the knowledge of knowledge , and now we &apos;re in knowledge .
this is a very normal conflict today , because children are going to send very easily into war .
the vietnamese of my mother was so bad that they were doing to make our story , all young and girls , and girls had given new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want to do that . it &apos;s just happening . they lost control .
and 70 percent won your life back .
i think it &apos;s given me energy .
this is the european average for the european average .
up on the right , the same energy consumption has the same energy consumption per person , about how canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but the population population is 300 times bigger , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to get a lot of solar cells , you &apos;d have to take the traditional water system , which you don &apos;t just have the roof , but the landscape of solar cells are covered with solar cells .
and a third possibility is nuclear .
i tried it . it works . some call it change of the lifestyle .
and as a young boy , i always wanted to be a musician , and god was thank you , i &apos;ve become it .
he &apos;s a young one from a community in caracas who did his favorite in the prison of the world &apos;s office with passion .
it encouraged them to put new dreams , new goals and progress in the different opportunities that have music .
this is a computer technology that helps you to do the simple pill , the right pill to the right time .
how do we call simple , more powerful technologies , and that &apos;s the first of five sentences that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk .
this is a year . she went into the most popular .
it &apos;s the first word &quot; doctor . &quot;
many of these generation will not press the button even if you have a computer company , because you don &apos;t want to fall to the burden , even if you paid for a long 30 dollars a month .
the color is different spaces in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and the inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want your credibility to go your own cab , you &apos;ll be .
how do you get a key key to a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine our predators we call fun of fun hackers , something called a little bit of a little bit more powerful .
there are some other interesting contributions that have uploaded the cybercriminals .
well , you probably ask yourself , what happened to these people .
in the world , i could identify hotels in which they were recently , in the world , with a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
thank you .
the adult can recognize the juveniles that can recognize the juveniles .
and they &apos;re in something that probably are the blood vessels that are going through the bones .
we all know that these bones are applied and if you appear to be in acid , it should be nothing left .
the most powerful ones are the big , they &apos;re extinct .
and it &apos;s also cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans stirling , also busy , was working with a little bit of the time .
people always say , &quot; why do you do that ?
finally , i started writing my book to show the global scale of this problem . this shows a graph of the individual nations to the site of food in every country .
so imagine that nine cookies i found in the garbage , represent the world &apos;s world &apos;s world , ok ? at the beginning we have nine .
this farmer has invested about 16,000 pounds in the growing of the flowering of the flowering , which he didn &apos;t give a sheet of , because a little grass potatoes , the ones that are not perfect , will be fed up to the pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut a piece of off , put it in a vase and it was another two weeks .
and if you use these things , they don &apos;t need to make them more .
i &apos;m going to go through a few .
on the left , after the left .
we need to change the stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , of course , the great , big , big set of sentence , and , i &apos;m not sure if the james &apos;s , or richard harris is .
and you can see how the icosahedron disappears in the dodecahedron , and then they just merge them together .
what a cat cat .
before horse before the horse before the horse before the horse .
&quot; 10 milligrams , 20 milligrams . &quot;
so , i said , if i put a circle , you see what patterns come out of the pattern , and , boom , the red system .
you have to be exactly . it &apos;s about measurements , the world &apos;s .
there was only two more of the internet in the internet .
i &apos;ll get to talk later .
i mean , all of the time to put it on &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; of your favorite , &quot; but for the whole world .
it could definitely be made of people here from the audience .
for example , if we had a chance to have a chance to have a chance of the way we had the opportunity to be talked about the current innovation of the military , about the massive of the military , and we could have predictions of stability in
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is prepared to attack to defense or attack , whether the weapons are going to attack the attack , this environment is what most of it is to do , a conflict .
it &apos;s a huge blue area .
so , you should have ever imagined in time to see how a dinosaur could look like a dinosaur , so it looks like a dinosaur .
you can &apos;t always shoot and shoot your threads ; you have to go down the pants .
he &apos;s never going to be saved at a certain girl .
but what i did was a computer company .
you don &apos;t have to worry that the readers fall in the world &apos;s office , because if you &apos;re already taking a shark shark , you &apos;re going to get your doubt back to the front door .
you will realize a kind of urgency , so that you can find as much as possible as possible .
my favorite was wonderful vague : surveys of the wild and pr .
that means i &apos;m going to take my love to math and to the magic to make something that i call &quot; performance &quot; .
audience : 25th .
audience : oldenburg .
audience : seven .
good . then i try the impossible -- or at least unlikely .
audience : november . the sixth of the day ?
of course , i could make a answer and you wouldn &apos;t know it . i &apos;m prepared .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a more powerful one ?
let me explain what that is .
i &apos;d love to talk about astronomy , but i think the number of people who are interested in the world &apos;s brain in the upper atmosphere and the top of the universe is the number of people who fit in a computer factory .
no , if you want to know how society will be in 20 years , ask a computer company .
just two weeks ago , i &apos;ve been -- you know , i &apos;ve made little , middle , middle and big , big .
my mentor . he came up and spent an hour to me .
i take a little bit of a time .
right ? this is simple physics .
if you &apos;re in the book , it &apos;s actually a little bit of a donation .
and i think , ah , the square of the length is proportional to the top of the length .
you would think , with all of this extra space , we would have a lot of space for all of our stuff .
it &apos;s time that i &apos;m going to get out of it .
would that be a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , the most prolific , there &apos;s no ice in october and november , and in november , there &apos;s no ice on the hudson bay .
it cost many years of personal health , before i really started to realize that i didn &apos;t really understand it .
frank wilson has a book called &quot; the hand &quot; .
so what does the play do for the brain ?
this has taken a long time -- i had to have homer &apos;s and i had to get it through the fmri and the kind of a little bit of a sudden and the kind of a little bit of a sudden , but when he was a computer
their own personal play play is unique and often nothing we think of .
he &apos;s characterized by a sense of a sense of the design of the world , complete , complete , success and success .
how do you prevent the media to interpret your work or the science , which is your work now , about how the most powerful , about how the most powerful , is that play is increasing .
the difference between our perceptual and the most powerful of the world &apos;s and the most powerful of the world is that our actually is a very powerful .
br : and then after a short , a little bit liquid in liquid nitrogen to get this perfect computer system , we really have something that &apos;s going to be tastes and acting like the original .
especially , the ipcc was wearing in paris , his report about people &apos;s climate change .
alisa miller gives us news about the news .
it allows you to look at the negative forms that you create , looking at your everyday life .
so , for this project , we developed a kind of intelligent computer scan .
no matter where i am -- it &apos;s about a process that tries to map my eyes .
inside , a 400 pounds of harder 12 times , which i &apos;ve been vaccinated by , from a friend .
there was thousands of people , we believe that they were infected with hiv .
: the deep thing is , deep in a remote region of the world &apos;s own , two hunters of their prey .
but they &apos;re also going to ask them a different question .
but if we came in this rural , we found that nobody had television , so they didn &apos;t know the face .
and to say that these viruses are probably extinct in the past with the coming in these rural societies .
you &apos;re telling what you &apos;re doing , with a help of 140 signs or less and people who are interested in this update .
we built a reduction of what means that programmers can write software that interact with twitter .
&quot; ... give people more information and follow their intuitions @ # ted . &quot;
there &apos;s all i read , books were in which people were foreigners , i believe that books were , from nature , and they had to act from things that i couldn &apos;t identify .
everything i heard about them was how poor they were , so it was impossible for me to see them as a poor .
and slowly , i realized that my american roommate during their life heard different versions of these only story , and saw the same thing that i had to say , just like this professor , that i said , &quot; authentic african . &quot;
you start the story of the north american native american native american native people with the arrows , and they &apos;re not telling the british , you know , a whole different story .
i always had the feeling , it &apos;s impossible to be really with a place or a person , if you don &apos;t do all the stories of this place or this person .
i &apos;m going to give every summer in lagos , and i think it &apos;s amazing how many people are going to be able to write how many people want to write , to tell stories .
in a recently , experiment were going to be a group of adults in a scanner , and the brains in a scanner was being carried in a scanner -- as people listened to experts .
why did my doctor , when i became surgery , &quot; woman hertz , you fit that you don &apos;t get a more powerful , &quot; instead of having a very simple , you know , i have to look at no high fever .
my father is sick of alzheimer &apos;s .
and read it as well as impossible .
even if it &apos;s difficult .
so we have to put in the physical and economic boundaries .
and then we also have our promise to the point .
if you have trouble , what the average consumer in the united states means in the u.s. economy .
if you want a fish , you get a woman and if you need a woman , you get a fish . &quot;
and if it &apos;s going to go a long ride , you can still change the battery and keep on the island .
this is after the u.s. war of the u.s.
in india , you don &apos;t understand where the problem is , because most indians are just two or three gallons of them .
everything we need is 10 percent of the energy .
we don &apos;t immediately put it on . maybe we &apos;re going to take the kids free and keep the slaves .
the arguments of the id theorist are the same old arguments that were always and over again , since darwin &apos;s times , for darwin &apos;s day .
the natural natural selection is so amazing , because it &apos;s the problem to explain complexity , in form of nothing else than simplicity .
now the next one : the president of the royal society gives a strong internal belief , &quot; -- -- &quot; -- &quot; -- that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
you feel in a computer minority , but how do american atheists actually get together ?
i have seen no numbers for other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed when they were different .
darwin was the opinion that atheism was right and good for the grim , that the most powerful people , but probably , &quot; are not going to be . &quot;
if people like -- if atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein uses the word &quot; god , &quot; you use it as a practical metaphor for this deep , mystic part of physics that we don &apos;t understand yet .
and the start cost about 500 dollars , about the value of 10,000 today .
used to be a person who had a license , you &apos;d have a license , and it had to be decided to be a license , and it had to be done in a field of license .
only because there &apos;s a certain sense of sense or a little bit of a sense of how to be involved in wikipedia , ) a certain sentence of social relationships .
i don &apos;t have slides , so you have to be able to get me to my own .
a study of the world &apos;s population has shown that there &apos;s a clear kind of a very clear thing in 28 african countries .
the state should not be involved in the production of the production and services because it &apos;s inefficient and richer on this area .
but what it was immediately carrying was the variability that we had dominated our economic development -- that &apos;s when the oil price was high , we grew up the economy very quickly .
the same thing we do in the field of the world .
and i &apos;d like to have that you &apos;d see that here .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that they could kill 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t have to know how a vaccine was doing exactly the same .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re making a huge triumph of science because they &apos;re the automated death sentence of a single time of a single time to you that have access to them .
but you know , the research that has been done in hiv has helped us with the progress of other diseases .
this was a slow , a slow process , which was dependent on chicken , millions of living chicken eggs .
and the kind of radical production of the world &apos;s and the vast of the e. , the giant of the e. , for example , is about the way i &apos;ve talked about -- look at the energy of the time -- that would be a life of
so the challenge is to advance full force .
the question is , why ?
do you think the african union is being organizing such a conference ?
there are some things that you have to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage , and i was in the stage , and i was going to have a little bit of a sudden that we had a leader of leaders in africa .
by being stealing by your suffering , people steal .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate the causal .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help of government , and he builds a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect all of us .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to be the balance of the world , because they &apos;re going to go to the way that they &apos;re going to click .
it &apos;s supposed to be new ideas , and we &apos;re going to be in new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; pretty beautiful home , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for more bad , and i &apos;m just doing fun -- but now just a short repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
until the most important in may it will be a update on version 2.0 , where you can go directly to buy the purchase of the brain .
even again , all the republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go to the world &apos;s .
what i really impressed to people on the gulf is that they &apos;re a little bit more nuanced .
and there &apos;s no more , except a few people who are trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the whole ocean that &apos;s all the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they were at least back back .
what the water of birds are doing is i don &apos;t want to make a more sophisticated remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who call themselves conservative when they really wanted to be conservative and really , they should be able to send these companies to the most powerful .
it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical boards .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to get it to the way it is true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain .
and that &apos;s just a very small thing . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now neurons , as the trees , can grow new branches and lose old .
and we can even talk about the most of the time .
if you celebrate these numbers , you can easily make a big potential for the brain in the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to know that we know ourselves through the wind and put our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on music videos and ads with his company , the most powerful .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , it &apos;s a matrix of the world &apos;s .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a friend to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is incredibly .
and then he found these wild plant , the most sophisticated plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what hell does that mean ?
at least , i &apos;m going to think .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to find answers instead of nature , instead of nature .
and from the old to the new fire , it means to change two big stories about oil and electricity that both ever have two fifth of the fossil health system in the air .
our fuel for mobility is going to be three fifth cars .
you can leave it quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
and better light and the size of the body and so lower the size of the world &apos;s surface .
in about 20 , private food cells , private solar cells without financial losses , are more sophisticated food on their roofs and lower their own .
and what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in net net -- although we buy more of it , what we have or new nuclear power and the other , or less centralized .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , can be able to be able to get the world &apos;s and conflict to the world &apos;s solution to the energy of america .
later , i realized that what i had eaten two of the family &apos;s family was all the family .
this simple thing shows that donor in areas , where the least kids go to school , don &apos;t have any schools , and this is a new question . do aid do that , and do it , the most important thing you need ?
two years ago , at april 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life came from four billion years ago -- four billion point two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there &apos;s a trap . it &apos;s a trap : the vertical .
you have time to think about it , you have time to talk about art and things like this .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they &apos;re all coming from families in which most of them are in home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure .
we &apos;re bringing them to the right , and on the left , so they can follow and know the consequences when they &apos;re going to be a little bit of their own .
let &apos;s go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the design of the brain .
then you can support us . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
let &apos;s take the most important thing to do .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia at all the content , and the end of the world has created the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep the sound apart of our own language , but not the stranger languages .
we went to the american babies that never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase , and they &apos;d hear the critical phase of the very critical phase .
it may look like a computer &apos;s atmosphere from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment while art usually has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live over here to show you this .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are more powerful .
the canvas was burned by a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the wound are all over the maggots .
suppose squares like the wild , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like them ?
we start with a computer and then we put another more important thing to do .
then there was a graphic project , a computer company .
i am , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; did i have what &apos;s going on ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a flashlight . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , magic is the only thing that &apos;s the only thing .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how tightly terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
and at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their lives weren &apos;t the ideology of ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people even thought i was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time .
but especially they went in serious , in serious , with organized crime .
this money was in the field of water and the water , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time in bar , and it &apos;s going to understand .
nobody wants to control his story , and he &apos;s going to put his own the story with clients .
some of you may think , &quot; wait . you don &apos;t necessarily see a little bit like a computer .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it was extremely uncomfortable , and he was very uncomfortable to leave his favorite .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special achievement , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t a lot of the time .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous to do because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable , more sustainable decisions .
so , the point of the pacific , why i &apos;m going to go through the pacific
this is the world trade trade on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see a surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that they feel good at places that they didn &apos;t feel good at the time .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do somebody , and one day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can get my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers i had written in the night .
we both got a lot of the back in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be able to put with the back of the world .
maybe you brought your own and a teeth , and you &apos;ve never told your teeth , because how can you say you &apos;re going to be buried in your own , if all of you want to be buried around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of his way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now three in terms of the number of three .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we &apos;re going to take a big part of our biggest world &apos;s largest , and replace it with most greenhouse gases of oil .
the most popular of your work is the fancy , which you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day , and it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s deeply related to the institution of marriage in relation to the institution .
and the shaw shaw was born in the street in the street , and in the world , in the world , and in london .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated is not always the same .
the most popular thing is , the one that we want to affect -- the public support for government .
so i proposed to my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week in video games .
only 30 minutes a day , for a major improvement of the mood , and the most important increase of the pleasure of the pleasure .
why a game ?
how could a game game make a huge effect in such serious , sometimes more profitable situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience that are going to contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically statements that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
through more practice , it &apos;s empowered .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , the most powerful thing is going to be fixed in your blood , which is &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing that with us , and actually , thousands of people are involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end of 2007 is the slogan of chicago festival , the global warming , we have a lot of the big gallery , and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
wool and the most powerful are not just two concepts that fit good .
pardon asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she was just recording . right .
so we have , from wool , the local world &apos;s population , the evidence that the most famous thing is the most famous thing that &apos;s wrong with mathematics .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular kind of thing -- the self -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in thanksgiving , and intelligent . but if he sees his mother , his delusion , he &apos;s going to take his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , they lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , as much as normal people , when i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mother , the most important activity is low .
he knows his arm is not there . nonetheless it &apos;s a compelling , a convincing experience .
maybe you can do the most powerful , the mangroves in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom and so no more , no more in the elbow , no a , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
and the blue is blue , charity is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is it &apos;s a fool ?
you &apos;re a little bit of the time to be able to do that most of us don &apos;t deal with it .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most powerful .
good done .
he learned that if he uses both hands , he &apos;s going to make a lot of hands with his specific , much larger and more powerful , and you can do a lot of the time .
a framework is a hut in the forest .
look where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that leave these remains .
on the right , gravity is the gravity . einstein explains this .
and it &apos;s going to get new kinds of change out of change .
it was too early , but he was a moral job , a inspiration for scientists who were concerned about control of the weapons .
let &apos;s take aliens in the cosmos , and we &apos;ve seen our main dot from far outside the cosmos and not only for 40 years , but all the four billion years of the earth &apos;s earth &apos;s population .
martin schwartz : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s still worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen of the plastic .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like ritalin and makeup .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormous incentives .
these are the most powerful ones in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it , they were actually going to be in other teams and they were actually the league of the league .
if we hear today from the most powerful , from the high , very often , we think that this is another one of these most sophisticated conflicts of the middle east , whose roots are so old as the region itself .
ironically , this was a time when the most iran of iran was peace , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s going to be able to make the diplomacy that diplomacy is , the diplomacy is inevitable , is inevitable .
you can look at certain kinds of things or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not the end of 2009 , not as well as you could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and she said , &quot; he was not a environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a computer &apos;s government .
so it &apos;s not about my theme that my theme is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , need to go back to the republic .
for example , some people are going to be in this room , and we went to the school with a scholarship .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m on my pen . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit crazy .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the model of the model of the brain .
if you see in north america , the way that many things are locked in the united states is more active in the united states .
every one of their favorite , the most important region , the most important region , the most important , which has the 10,000 independent cells , has a electronic rhythm -- a high tension -- a high tension , a low , low -- to send a signal
they were a while in synchrony , but then they were apart .
so i want to first show you a few interviews with people who were at opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t normally hold yourself for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and go back to the walk .
im : this is just a few tons of tons , so it &apos;s right .
but the most popular scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in a very , very good order , and i told you , you should look for your name , your favorite , or the name of your mother .
also , maybe this developer or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economic , a resilience against disease or bonuses or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the other one doesn &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body body ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one at the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they will be replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to my thesis .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about commercial development of the world &apos;s population .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences is .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is , is the most important thing .
the tahltan is from the most popular .
you know that bees and fish live in schools .
all around us , a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with including .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a rustle mass , a brain , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of blood supply disappears to treatment .
but the real question is : how good do these things work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a computer system . it prevents angiogenesis to very effective .
but more interesting , the study is coming out that men who have developed the most powerful , so that the ones that have been able to get more tomato sauce , the bottom blood vessels have been feeding their cancer .
albert von the once said , &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you have seen , and think of what nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a very , very , very , in discover magazine .
it has to make fun differently than everyday problems that are not very good to be able to do a lot of puzzles .
this is the background of the other .
you may not do that physically , but on a computer it &apos;s going to be . over the computer , it &apos;s over .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction is that you &apos;re going to fall here ?
so there are games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the nintendo dave , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really believe that a girl is to be so powerful that we had to train all of them .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , struck me .
we &apos;re used to steal girls of the discovery of the discovery , to be the other life that we actually did to objects , and they &apos;ve turned them into the way .
and she looked at your baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual , which she &apos;s girl who are the learner , with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your own life on your side . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take the things easy .
why should you turn me to the , you want to do it ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers were going to be out and the most prolific , which they had made by the photo photo .
but the incident was in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what about keeping us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a computer company and i traveled through africa , where i asked people why they were building fractals , what a great job is when you can get it .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast and they &apos;re very cheap .
and it &apos;s odd , odd power .
we have a computer company in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of turning on friends or family , they looked at the workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up to the world &apos;s brain .
fear of the shooting of the day is losing .
we &apos;re going to make some rules on them and hold them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
now , when i &apos;m going to go back tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to get a little bit of daughters .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read the first time &quot; anna &apos;s &quot; and the famous first sentence , &quot; all happy families , the same thing .
i want to show you how to look at a little bit of invisible .
if i came up with the water , you see a silver , and this is the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to keep the water from the water of the brain &apos;s water . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla was not about the duration of the duration .
one thing i want to do is not all the neurosurgeon , not all the neurosurgeon .
we can do it or turn it down , and it &apos;s going to go on or turn .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what the brain areas for the clinical signs and symptoms are responsible for the clinical signs .
evolution is actually working in reality as a fellow , as a engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being like richard , or a cockroach or a crab or a suite , the relative of this feather , which is the relative of all that we &apos;ve seen until now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students tried it and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he &apos;s doing this with a prosthetic glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and imagine with another colleagues from berkeley .
and that &apos;s what was going on by the married of the young , two thirds of the young men , but only one third of the married women .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at , and say , &quot; how did it go to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named heidi &apos;s .
and i got my hand back , and i fell in all the other women , and then you &apos;ve been asking more questions , just from men . &quot;
a woman was beaten me on this , and i looked at it -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it so close , but they &apos;re doing it .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s the black thing to do in the middle .
i want to talk to you about how we &apos;re going to spread in this country , how we get to information .
so they &apos;re in clean , more clear language , and that works .
we tell you that everything is okay ; it &apos;s good to you .
this patient is about 50 , we can say pretty much , as big as the risk is to get cancer cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing that i &apos;m going to get this flower , these flower , i get the nectar and then i get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , the author of my favorite theme is how is the idea of the most powerful ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap , very new , a car car , and actually , in a car car , i could close to a very noisy of 10 terabytes in 15 minutes .
if a computer &apos;s office , the grass is going to be on this height of this filter , and it &apos;s happening immediately something interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your drinks to half the price .
and then you can actually achieve good ways of doing good .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the most popular dynamic is a community that tries to find the best news , which is most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about the last time a lot of years ago .
you also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world too much .
you can see here , there &apos;s begun .
this is one of our engineers .
and the one that was actually going to have been teaching students to teach the law of the world &apos;s law , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so this is something we work , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel , like he said , wanted to reach for his passengers , was the experience of the landscape .
what does life make easier , pleasant ?
and it &apos;s part of the way that you do that by building a great new facility , using the basement of your hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been the same thing that &apos;s been done in the present problem , and they have become part of the present problem .
and as brunel can , we can do that by making us a greater effect .
from my persistence , the waiter was surprised with his boss .
mark &apos;s and i &apos;ve tried to answer a series of studies , just to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the european european , the world &apos;s bank was the aquatic availability of all these things on the market like a computer .
americans themselves discover that unlimited choices seem to be more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just like , &quot; noah was just for so short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said , &quot; it &apos;s poetry , who &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant , pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re a lot of problems that are controlled by forces .
so thank you very much .
it should replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a computer company that we can test the height of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most best thing is not going to be understood as a computer company , but as a business movement .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power , which would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your television , and you &apos;re going to get out of the outside of it , right .
if you replace the word of the blogosphere or today , it &apos;s very real that his perception is now very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very .
i think it was this exchange that led to a computer company .
ph : i hope you understand how to do that .
finally , the race has won the future to momentum than the phone phone .
mm : because it has given a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has been , what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking about thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can be simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think it &apos;s going to be .
it gave me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk to us and build some installations .
the use of the city for public space is a major , almost a international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , as i was , after some of the most powerful and a design , the design of the chair ended up , i &apos;m going to show you the same .
he said she was one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to pull them up in the position .
but i knew , but i was looking at experience , and when i looked around the offices , where there was a lot of the idea of the idea that no anyone would come to the idea , to turn to a computer , and to make it
and water fever has spread in the world .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i &apos;m reading in a computer factory , that the first one is the first thing that &apos;s been the first thing that &apos;s been the first thing that &apos;s about 52 , about 52 times cases , about
we need something that was really a really important thing that he &apos;s not doing , so he &apos;s not spreading the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hits females , lots of offspring .
so , the most important problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i don &apos;t remove myself , although i &apos;m a computer company .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now build a story of our main system .
bill &apos;s : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
and that &apos;s the simple reason that nobody is talking about it .
as the beginning of the beginning , plants are going to move phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a computer of nature , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is going to be mentioned .
and instead of taking a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that &apos;s going to use some of the most powerful things that we &apos;re going to do on the world &apos;s world &apos;s population .
and he was a called a called a called the &quot; he &apos;s all watching the entire , mutations and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms . &quot;
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are going to repeat , but they &apos;re repeat without being a more powerful .
as an architect , i just think of relationships between the pieces and all the time , but in terms of design design , it &apos;s always more a matter for companies .
we were going to be in the level of the building of the building where we could build five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single mass of mass .
and let &apos;s go back to a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually going to look at the same as a rainforest .
the difference is especially in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most powerful in the desert , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now , in the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just just by fertilizers that cause huge problems in the water quality , rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing to do for the most important .
but we can do this and there are opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest most fundamental thing on the top of the world .
work together .
so -- what is the system of system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system of system is not paying taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological islamist to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve free , and we put other pristine things from the world &apos;s brain and we had other pristine people who were our own -- signal . two other people who are going to give us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put a electrode and say , &quot; there &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically more accurate to carry .
this is jesse and he press a computer .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people in hiv , which are more powerful 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments have to create effective , effective , for ethical aspects of ethical trials , which are approved in the different developing world , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with are a high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet criteria that usually love people .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the most powerful in this case -- the one to the galapagos , and that &apos;s the most important , the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , the galapagos .
we also know that not only a lot of the time is threatened , but the same way and other things .
now i want to show you that penguins are moved in the field of time .
turbo has a fool to pat with his alibi , and we &apos;re going to go in and it comes in .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of the ones are a pretty long frontier .
again , like mongolia , china is not confronted russia , it &apos;s not a lot of the way . it &apos;s going to be .
for the world , china reduces its own , so that the most powerful and cambodia were going to sell their cheaper and to be a little bit more cheaper to china .
what i want to introduce you here is i call a day , day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the brain , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza bar .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union look ?
53 countries and far the most of the suspects straight lines on the map .
this dream exists his time .
it &apos;s bad to him ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor is supporting growth .
so how can a hormone end the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and the other hormones are hormones , which are particularly active under the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is enough , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on life expectancy of people .
basically , you could change genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about is that the worm is very quickly going to have a different normal , a different normal , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see a ad , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most powerful .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a computer company .
this view is that many of the most powerful things like prozac is essentially changing the chemistry of the brain , as if in fact , the brain of the container is a chemical soup .
and my favorite colleague seymour thinks that also .
and we found out that a mutant , a lot longer needed to get a lot more , and when we were the genes , and when we were the genes that played in this mutation , we could discover a computer system .
so , this question has been asked for a long time , but in flies , we can actually test it .
so , the mosquitoes are finding us in the dark by putting us out of it . they smell us .
just with it , it &apos;s the cheese .
people even said that they &apos;d like to be abused by mosquitos .
in the field of time .
and every time i felt the dragon , the eyes of the eyes was going to be a prisoner behind me .
and as it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the best sources of adults , fat stem cells .
while we talk about a little bit of a sudden , about a little bit of a time of the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when that &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
and the most important thing is , what you don &apos;t know about marriage .
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make this receiver with help of material that is coding in dna .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it &apos;s going to be the way it &apos;s going to be , but it can &apos;t really go , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it &apos;s changing while the animal learns through experience .
and by many such experiments , we were able to put identity in the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the world &apos;s brain and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior from the physical interaction is in living matter .
here &apos;s kiki , or actually a computer &apos;s book of unicef .
ed : yeah . tb : okay . a little bit of a bit of a bit more to the middle .
and i know from the own experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite of legacy .
one i &apos;m telling you , this kind of care of care that includes everything , from their goals to their genes , will change the change that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc &apos;s favorite was built the most prolific .
what would happen if you climb on the bottom of the paper , and it would come to a little bit of a time or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , they &apos;re also done . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , as you could see that in a computer factory .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising level level .
and i would say , people who work in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re the opinion of it , and we should be a lot lower .
this is the ship i was the last three months in antarctica .
when this ice goes up the sea level around six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for coral islands are the galapagos of the galapagos .
you &apos;re the sun &apos;s water .
but then , at the end , you see the most important thing in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to the co2 in the atmosphere of millions of years , and we &apos;ve always done this with a lot of years , but we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , to figure out how gravity works .
einstein has already been in space and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space hidden , so the idea could give it more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello , the strings of a cello can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get strings in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of the things that are able to explain some of the things that are going on in the world , or can we actually show these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colorful dots .
now , can it see the predator that is the predator that is in the way that it &apos;s going to attack ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is generally true for all information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , which is a pretty hammer in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the dark in this shadow would be in the shadow , and the same amount of light would reflect on your eye like the top outside the shadow , you &apos;d have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
where do you know that ?
and she comes into the beehive , finds a blank , and you &apos;re going to be a blank , and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
voices ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right here or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , the runway , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , avian flu , flu flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the way that we tend to accept data , and we &apos;re going to be able to reject data that we &apos;re going to tell you about , and the data is to disagree with
i &apos;m familiar with another group , if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near near , stanford .
they had good history with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to figure out whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to put it on it , and save them , or save me as a volunteer hand , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert : a park in the sky
and groups were very often called terrorists .
they need a design process , which can be able to deal with the core of this very complicated society with his problems .
it &apos;s about the first time we &apos;re probably in the history of the arab world , a revolution of the ground , a computer system .
paradox is that the last decade was so promising , and that &apos;s a reason of a reason .
and once the ngos were not going to be able to do their own , they don &apos;t just have the streets -- they took them into the negotiations , and they were in the negotiations of the world , because they &apos;re going to be the victims of
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a &quot; good thing . &quot;
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new computer system .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the laundry comes out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer to a audience that has a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it turns out a huge amount of information in genetics , by just comparing the genetic resemblance .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is very connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single one of the most powerful than a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of the time , or some of the things that are .
where we really have to get , is the process that &apos;s just going to be happening , and that &apos;s the level of the brain &apos;s activity on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t cure itself , how it normally makes it ? &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : the cancer of proteomics
they all are members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people to give them .
because on stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried something like this .
in fact , martin luther king was in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got the most sophisticated out and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to get the little pieces of plastic up .
this is the way that we &apos;ve been doing that or a more , more and more , and the other thing that was designed to make the control of the ground to make the taxes for the ground , to the ground that they &apos;re not a permanent
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , and you compare them to the remote construction of a computer &apos;s book in high high high high high high high high high rooms .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the kind of kind of sense of the form of the sense of the sense .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be going to be , to bring compassion to the more unequal images of suffering that otherwise could be in the blink of the suffering .
gandhi was also a really more powerful person .
and the first day , our main system was going to be our head and taught us our motto that we had to do every day for the rest of the summer to make the challenge .
this is one of two or three of their known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without imitating the other thing .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s way to learn my own kind of thing .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , you &apos;re going to be a internal picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much of education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to face incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , and it &apos;s a lot of the solutions , and it &apos;s a lot of solutions .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in the process of trying to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me and i said , &quot; you know , i remember you , i remember you , that every generation has to make it better than the previous .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them in 1980 with another family .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , as before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball is represented your identity , which you are .
when my kids were small , i went to her room , sat on her bed , sat on her bed and looked at my children .
it &apos;s less than i had a lot of time -- i &apos;m going to be able to do three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for the most famous chinese character .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re going to be a bit of a sense of the way you &apos;re going to be a bit of a bit of a time ?
we really learn that really bad lesson .
think about it for a moment , how it &apos;s in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly subtle book about a subject that all hate , for a audience that would never give it .
the effect of course is not just a lot of the wheat wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; this is even worse . &quot;
our main , a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the persian , our most prolific , has tripled our main system .
and bhutan , for that , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often going to hunt in the west , as if happiness is something we need to capture , a thing that we need to capture , or maybe several things we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions , so that our employees can live their appeal .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under deck of the deck , you tell you the inner ear , you move you . but the eyes are moving in the balance with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , you get up to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they allow them to express this , and so amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity .
we were thrown down in the &apos; 70s .
and to come up there , we have to recognize that the principle of a design system doesn &apos;t just hurt the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is also our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody has already wondered , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor of the davis of davis , and i got a lot of attention to this . that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall down and end them up here .
i mean , people ask themselves whether mobile phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. &apos;s , the most popular cell phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , in which not the most powerful , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing toxins in our bodies .
first , a computer , and a computer , which is called &quot; the death penalty &quot; .
only months later , i learned who he really was .
i search for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this kind of paper , we have the hope of the hope of the hope , and we &apos;ve always defined hope again .
but a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was defeated .
to allow you to get it back to the driver &apos;s seat .
we &apos;re going to be able to do this area , we &apos;re going to send people to people , we &apos;re going to send the buildings out of the inside , the building of the inside , and we helped the first thing to do with the first
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original detail . in the opposite , i could write history here .
you &apos;re going to be fooled by the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years of life in the indian woman .
what political change is , they introduced them to the same .
china , i think , has still some of the very amazing , more powerful foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health care , a sense of equality that &apos;s not in india .
it was a place where people with the other species of the world and with different kinds of plastic and the other things that are going on .
and now they have the problem that they spent the whole money to afford help with this progressive electronics in these countries and now everything is useful .
a little chaotic environment , where many ideas came out , where people are more interesting , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , more interesting , human heritage .
about a or two decades ago , a wonderful computer company went to howard , and read darwin &apos;s notebook , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
does it go the other way ?
in the 1970s , the &quot; one percent of the national income in the united states was in the united states .
many of these political factors can be roughly in the category of capitalism , political , political , which help a group of good with each other , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you can see right , how globalization and technological revolution are creating this global rule of money , it &apos;s much harder to evaluate all the time .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern world &apos;s modern .
this is his little hand .
in one of them , we &apos;re going to die all .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you &apos;re taking care of the treatment , and you can eat a toxic dose , just half a percent of people have ever done it .
so long talk short , you know , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as the most of the time of our time , how did the good and the bad ones together ?
some articles actually went to say that skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s about the cancer , but it &apos;s a lot of the way that they spread in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s that these are these kinds of tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is the most important , that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , to control the tumors that are going to
this is a very far idea , but i really believe that it &apos;s possible .
after that , my translator left me .
she was the girl who &apos;s going to get the other to her team .
and the same thing that i wrote on this is a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from a very korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , look out , and see how flames from the side of the hotels in the height are going to shoot . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took out and kept them on our faces and the children .
until the adoption is . a year ! what &apos;s so long ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , which is a few days old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper , more important thing , is that the science is that science is the life , how we know it , to define it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the toughest universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all of the stars , right here .
thank you very much .
look at , while uganda goes down and zimbabwe down , russia went down to a percent .
they find the highest hiv guess in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , and there are the same rate in the united states , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be that it &apos;s something else , which is the transmission of the transmission .
we know about a half billion people ever lived .
this wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just with institutions .
you have to give me just food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions to the future billion , short , in the united states , when the united states is losing their place as number one economy .
no , we &apos;ll be able to get out of the giant , regardless of the giant , which we &apos;ve been putting in , regardless of the signs that we have lost our work work and other parts of our historical design system .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely completely out of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are quite diverse .
also , a high potential of their ability to be a lot of potential to the design of their ability .
what i want to pay attention to is not the mermaid , so lovely you may be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what &apos;s going on is that 80 percent of the cuban people have contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what &apos;s going on to the self .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states that are trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
she was built by making your favorite , the use of many of these tools , analyzed the intelligence intelligence of the world today , and the world &apos;s intelligence is the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have a lot of the time that &apos;s probably for us , and the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the way that we can see the kinds of connections in a deeper level -- my search is just about the answer to what &apos;s so special ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that you &apos;re alive , and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent from every beer .
it will be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a design of the talk .
it takes very , very long , and the scores of writing , and i work at a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to be the hair .
it &apos;s going to show by brian &apos;s , which is an extraordinary artist .
and you have a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- betty &apos;s , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a plastic , and a bowl with a plastic system .
i mean , last , when we look at babies , they seem to be pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the most important thing is to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like the research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist &apos;s favorite , the psychologist , the great , the very clever , is the great thing that &apos;s going to capture , and make decisions as babies are doing more subtle
if i could be a little bit of a demonstration for a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeat this process , and again , until something is going to come out of it , and that &apos;s what the character is going to be like , like i go straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
it can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , like he got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some studios already use our software to do exactly the same , and we &apos;ll have a few of our main types of our own in a few major ways .
we thought he just would hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the top of the world -- how most of you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity is essential to developing empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times column , then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;m going to do today is , by frustration .
some stories are just classic , but so it &apos;s so much .
it &apos;s a little bit of the time . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word -- that might happen !
but i think there are actually two microsoft .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard standard .
and the one of the things that i &apos;m doing is , if somebody writes a little bit of a time -- what &apos;s going on every day -- i say , &quot; kiss me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most powerful technologies , nanotechnology , and other people in the come to come in the way that we &apos;re doing a lot of digital technologies , i made very big care about the most powerful .
and to limit the danger of this new things , we have to ultimately limit the ability of individuals to make them in principle to make access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re standing in -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , will we develop these kinds of things that are going to take us from this device to be able to take us from this
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of the little of the little , and it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time , which is for us to be quite
and if you use the concept of insurance companies , you can make a much more powerful unit -- the fusiform of the market -- using feedback .
12 years ago , caves started to be fascinated with me , and i turn my research into this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of life form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there is actually a big number of things .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have a lot of properties that used to be used by people and other organisms as habitat .
whenever you &apos;re a goal to be a goal , to be able to make certain steps , certain effort are going to be taken on .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
the external , it was made , and it suffered under extreme water .
that means before we could start digitize the most powerful , we had to take the book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but by flying around the electrons with light speed , they give x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip von the telegraph had a son named alexander of the great , and she lost the battle of the internet .
because in the moment , institutions are going to be their data with the data and so much .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most enthusiastic of the 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a little bit of a pattern is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a computer company , a toilet toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get in the finger , and that was the northern cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of the one of the things that i &apos;m doing -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i was not impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for the divine real dollars .
that really interesting about virtuality , is that you can measure them .
now , i could develop a game with the name of the name , by just bringing a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok , then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical , and virtuality is amazing at it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so in 1999 , there was a video game called a video game called the &quot; a video game . &quot;
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insight that we get when we observe people playing in play .
it &apos;s a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there are all the hunger in america in america , 49 million people and almost more and more of the million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of the grain of grain and the big computer , from chicken , and the big computer system , the car &apos;s , the world &apos;s disease , the world &apos;s disease , and the change of the way we &apos;re in agriculture .
this is a computer that i &apos;ve got two years ago , and that was one of the largest projects that i &apos;ve ever been involved in , and my company was involved .
but i &apos;m going to just be able to get a very simple thing to the beginning of the process , three very sophisticated talks .
if we &apos;re so good , where we &apos;re doing , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that are absolutely a lot of a lot of the design and the most powerful thing ?
the architectural use was said , &quot; well , simple . &quot;
and this is the real way of being able to get the effort .
the second technology we used to use , we use things that you know from the most of the opera .
here you see the air configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to get stories to the way that you &apos;re going to do a little bit of time .
one of these projects is about a year old .
this is the images that automatically create .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . well , further .
a computer tag of a computer &apos;s data .
an 11-year-old , a farmer , the farmer .
what if you found the truth for just a year , what would you do the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business &quot; was the indian .
while the anesthesia was told you he wanted to be , and he had given me a little bit of a chance of chance .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , writing has a benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible except in the world , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that .
if someone was seen in 1973 , the most powerful board of 1993 would have been a little different for the time of &quot; love story &quot; , but he had understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at whitney , and also in the most violent , in the world &apos;s office .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t represent existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a two-year-old optimism optimism .
diplomats dig up in the field of time .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success , was the great part of our success -- in the careful way of our , in the very careful way .
rory , she said libya to finally .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you how it looks .
there are also a lot of the time that &apos;s going to be the nonprofit , but if you &apos;re going to get these things out of the world , these are used for another kind of plastic of the world .
the most powerful thing . this is a difficult problem to do that i &apos;m not going to be able to do .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is lead to a very bad thing about a general system in general .
so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal food that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the cost of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the most prolific thing that &apos;s going on ? &quot;
so we need to ask why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who don &apos;t have as you are .
so we can think about things like the most powerful .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half when i say that you &apos;re going to believe in the hospital , if you get a missing limb , without previous , mri and the most prolific .
then bell turn on his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , and early 20th century , the doctor was trying to put a diagnosis , the most diagnosis , the most popular .
between the perception of the patient and the doctors in terms of the best medical care , a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas before i went to stanford , turned me .
the bad news : we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t see . look ? that can do that , we can do it . &quot;
i remember so many giant , more powerful , and i &apos;ve been following eyes that i &apos;m going to do in this ritual .
some call us a more powerful term , a rather more sophisticated term .
in this case , we &apos;ve tested this .
for you , there &apos;s a miracle , &quot; then a miracle happened !
and there was no way to get out of it .
religious favorite .
harder is to move the dead to a response .
my friend simon &apos;s , a computer professor , was a little bit of a sudden , the book , &quot; the big bang &quot; etc . &quot;
and now they open their eyes .
you can open it completely , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
but it &apos;s been inspired to think that these guys , at least most , knowledge , what they do for living .
all of this thought that was impossible .
you can create lots of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo webb has no invented the world &apos;s favorite and middle class in venezuela , and he just led them .
and so it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? today , modern medicine is used a 60 years old .
there &apos;s another catch there .
it &apos;s going to make it faster , over 26 times cheaper and over 400 times more than our current energy system for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with islamic world is very different .
there &apos;s a little bit of the character .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why babies are in relationships a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of desire .
especially , in this description of the other or my self -- this is the same -- especially interesting , that there &apos;s no more powerful thing in desire .
this is your favorite , and the memex , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
then , this is what desire is going to be , this study takes curiosity , and this is what curiosity takes .
you know that there &apos;s a erotic space that everybody belongs to .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a cathedral cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so , early , some of the things that have been doing is a few digits .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , these adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s where there &apos;s !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring to language ?
albert einstein -- i just talk to someone when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s going on in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later : &quot; rarely , a powerful mind with this big humility of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to mourn the only one about the most sophisticated .
but it &apos;s going to be about 10 minutes , and a woman in the arm take the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never was in .
harvest the water .
with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman is president of president , and she says , how you and her siblings live together , her parents died in war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do , how it &apos;s happening in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look back for 20 years , and i see that there &apos;s a girl &apos;s girl , a nigerian girl , a nigerian girl , a nigerian girl on this ted stage .
lg : like , i want to happen .
and it was the fact that computers can do the necessary , and they can prepare the necessary to prepare insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer , your computer , you &apos;re a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these records were human health .
by being introduced to a more productive process , what else is a task for 40 months , was to a simple task for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all the things that are winning .
we should stop seeing out of it .
and the dinner with my wife and the children go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have a time to get out of it .
she was a much bigger dog when i thought .
these effects affect us all .
the boom of the national national system is to our problems .

in the era of katrina , we have more together .
and they all have done that , and if not , they &apos;re going to have to be .
help me make green to new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
in this case , you take a little bit of a sudden , put it on a pile and the pile of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case that the big fish is .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
if kids are creating such projects like this , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought that great cars is a soul , very useful , it &apos;s all knowledge . they all know that . they see a car with soul with the first sight . they know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper instead of a studio and six or seven apartments , and they &apos;re going to be a seven of the homes in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other , and we were going to be able to get strings through , and we were going to be able to do the concept for the real creature of true , and creativity .
we didn &apos;t get him to boston .
i just have a little lab .
now we have clinical trials in four of these diseases , and we &apos;re going to take a clinical trials in four of these disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of the computer and the computer , which can be able to be able to put this drugs on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to think about is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so , though the universe is going to continue forever and ordinary matter and radiation , they &apos;re going to be able to give a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it great fluctuations .
it &apos;s reflected down .
it &apos;s a very distinctive fact of the universe that you &apos;re accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something that i &apos;m going to say to the africans , like me , saying to africans and the poor with their dreams .
no matter what movement i was doing in my real world only with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in the years 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bike bike , and put it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that &apos;s good .
the camera is not just understanding my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding what things i think is in my hand .
and why just the most powerful ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is juan klee , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , in june , this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep under the earth to build a stick station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have this horrible computer system .
we &apos;re under the average in terms of the city in the city .
a city of the future is a city that nobody &apos;s cutting out of this great community , which is cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwin &apos;s &quot; in the &quot; 1992 of our artistic and aesthetic preferences . &quot;
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so you &apos;re going to make a kind of attraction , so you just look at joy , just looking at it .
and some are in every case to make them a lot of battles .
our strong response on images , for the expression of feelings in art , is going to be in the world &apos;s sky , and our offspring are being able to be the long time , as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try and explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see the computer here , and there &apos;s no one that you can see , and you can &apos;t see the driver &apos;s driver , we actually can see the driver &apos;s driver , so it can actually see what &apos;s going on .
and if mark can avoid you .
or for blind people , in everyday devices in the household , education and in the office .
a subtle thing was , the most subtle thing was , the most common people who don &apos;t hear voices , and i heard it , but i was hearing that something was not going to be a matter of me .
my mental health was a catalyst for a catalyst , hate and physical and sexual and sexual , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , &quot; it &apos;s better than schizophrenia . &quot;
to be a 24-hour , if the social change begins , it can &apos;t be a fool .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through right now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that there &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , even though mars is a very much more powerful and more interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s the kind of life that can live out there , it has enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high thing , and the very high furniture , and the other thing that &apos;s a little bit of a child , and the naked , and naked -- pretty scary things for a small child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they might be able to do things that people are using in a new way and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most important thing is that we decided that we decided that all the technical gadgets of the world , this whole whole , and tried to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example of that , which is all together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that the development of the brand , it &apos;s all deeply interconnected .
this is my favorite anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to go back to him again . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly powerful and brilliant woman , was early .
she was the most popular of the women who i ever heard .
look at these young girls who go back to school after acid was in their faces . &quot;
the world that had been given layma was a world in war .
then the situation will be a lot of the way .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , which is growing up in a world where everything is in the world , and in some of our best conversations on a screen .
and ultimately , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if it &apos;s asking them why it &apos;s interesting , they have to look at the rest of saudi arabia because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s shared between the males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very powerful republic , we had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time that i call the universities , which is the universities that should
if i would be the only person that thinks that we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims saw europe as an example , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. &apos;s process was the efforts of turkey , the e.u. , in turkey , in turkey , in turkey , in turkey , as some of the countries were about .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be the fact that it &apos;s connected to anything .
if scientists are today , a century later , neurons want to make neurons , and then they &apos;re going to get out of the inside , rather than they &apos;re going to get to the place .
carl ornish : insights in the inner world
but this trend is less clearly .

and the number of continents moved over continents . the big journey started .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have a bit of luxury .

ultrasound has more infections to the consequence of other technologies , and it &apos;s not very prevalent .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than a centimeter , the survival is about 90 percent , but it falls massive with the increase of the increase .
the picture of mbi shows a lot more likely to do the same way of a second tumor that &apos;s very strong on the surgical possibilities of the patient .
it costs a radiologists for years of special education to be a expert in this , a normal , a normal detail of a computer .
some women who get breast cancer die , many years later , and fortunately , most of them survive .
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da vinci there is a lot of power .
we put these physicists in los angeles to see what they build .

so let &apos;s go on the point .
what did i do ? i heard on my belly ?
this is interesting . this is another kind of thinking .
the divine is basically a visualization of a human being where everybody &apos;s part of the surface is to be the surface that he &apos;s going to be in the brain .
that &apos;s white noise .
and db will probably roll into your direction .
i did just to make money .

this is the reason i was with david edward , a scientist made of harvard , a object that can absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedy of other people can take easier than the own and i want to be just going to be the most powerful mind of this conference .
according to malcolm gladwell , &#91; the &#93; cocaine was the air cocaine of tomato sauce for the inner city .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back into the second stick and said , &quot; hey boys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
so , think about other people &apos;s most powerful , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and was .
economists talk about theory -- that every game for two people have a computer company .
and the most playful is skydiving with a board on the feet .
so , in the way , the way that you &apos;re doing it is just possible when you &apos;re going to practice step for step , if you really work , if you &apos;re really physically physically , you &apos;re going to work in a very powerful way .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that by having some natural elements , a little fog , i could make the room tangible .
so , the most compelling thing is that it makes a difference , whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distant distance are moving less .
how do we create a notion that is both of the assumptions of individuality , and also to vary , without the two in two different directions ?
i talked about new kinds of the world &apos;s favorite , one that is attracted to the animals instead of sweating .
but the incredible thing was the material , which was the most important thing .

and he taught the classic at the top of the college at the university of the college .
natalie merchant : singing old poems about life
and it &apos;s not a dolphin &apos;s worth of a dolphin .
as a adult , when i was about the amazing insights of penny , and bobby , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , and panbanisha , the most excited , i heard , i heard , i was excited about it .
and the ng is : ng : how the one .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re engaged for the very amazing , for the research and the research .
but we realized pretty quickly that we had made a system that connects people to each other .
today , this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter we hold a israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that , i remember that , i remember that , i remember that , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the most popular . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is the war . but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;re doing with &quot; yes is more &quot; to try to question that the architectural is almost defined by the architectural , and so on , which is what we are .
and we saw this guy , and we saw this guy .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life makes less fun than normal .
so , go on the expo first to the danish pavilion , and you get a wheel , and drive to the other , and drive to the other .
it was interesting because they talked about nine to 11 to 11 , and how many billion they should invest in the economy of the economy .
this is a computer &apos;s favorite of switzerland . in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need to be a national need of the world &apos;s own .
we often do small films .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s of course a problem when you &apos;re asking people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m going to do is say , really , we have a very long time to have a situation that we had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little , very high cost .
the most successful thing about malaria is to be a few million infected per year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of that , that i want to see it , but don &apos;t expect to be in the next movie brad pitt &apos;s next movie , like he was in tanzania , or something like that .
they had all the same material , but they could leave the frame of the discussion , and they &apos;ve done it to be able to do with their own lists .
his power , wealth and greater freedom , is a lot of freedom . &quot;
secondly , china has done it to reduce income income , without changing the political framework .
freedom house found that , although 50 percent of all countries are democratic , 70 percent of them are in the democratic , and in terms of that , people are not a more sophisticated or more of them .
because finally , the question that we &apos;re doing and seven billion other people on this planet is how can we create wealth ?
the most powerful is not right at your place .
we &apos;re going to be what really interested in .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s going to be incredible attention .
you have to make a cause of growth .
i think it looks easy to human skin , which is fascinated me .
but i think it could be a pretty clever and sustainable set of power to our own resources .
chinese workers are not going to be able to be able to be in factories because of our own demand for ipods .
just because one person spend their time to make a piece of something called a piece of something called that , that it &apos;s going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some understand that just . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the most important thing to tell me about the head of the day in the train .
the taliban are going to run their schools .
if any child gets caught , it will be punished hard .
if i look at suicide bombers , the younger ones are younger than i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by their attacks .
and this is going to be on the line , just there on enceladus , waiting for the most of the future , which hopefully are in the middle future , especially to pursue this question .
is the internet actually a place that you can visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started to engage , there was only a cable along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve song as thin black line .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to me right .
this data is sent to layer for layer , starting with the basis of the product , and puts the material layer on layer , by the new business of the world , by the new layer of the world &apos;s old layer .
it was made by the layers of layers of layers of the layers of about four .
a suite will probably be less likely .
you can just make it directly right now .
this is what it &apos;s made .
without any doubt , i think that technology is creating a revolution in production and the most powerful as we &apos;re going to change them .
he was worried that if he called them in this name , especially outside , in the public , you might think he would be a match of jihad .
they use his own .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
but many of these factors that played a role is even stronger , and half the work is done .
i was with my friend susan , photographer , photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the opposition and the embarrassment of all the thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months of flies , and forget about it , the time was very much more powerful .
but it &apos;s less likely to stay .
and during my first year , i was going to go on my company .
it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to make a solar cell , as you get in your entire world &apos;s entire world .
but solar cells are going to collect light for four hours .
and they &apos;re also in a big pressure , and so they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a computer company .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the most powerful in the way that it &apos;s got the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder on the top -- this part is hot , and it comes out of electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have any of these energy , that energy so fast to use it .
we &apos;re going to go and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we did in the region of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poems , and he never broke the air in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from the most important things , great things can come -- -- that i &apos;m going to go to a picture that eventually will land in my work .
i work for the new yorker and i do the , and then the 11th came to september september and that was , um , a very , a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
then &quot; summarize &quot; , and it &apos;s a little bit more unclear , and it &apos;s like that , and that &apos;s what we understand . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his favorite was extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody everywhere on his staircase are distributed to the staircase , and basically -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
and she &apos;s also running up with george &apos;s , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different obligations were given me , and when i was young , it was always that my way was a lot of time .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process is going to be happening in internal level .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let &apos;s take a little bit of what she did , so that it &apos;s happening and i was sometimes pretty resistant to this , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and they have other ones that have learned it in reality .
if i say , &quot; i mean , i &apos;m going to do my advice for the ted .
but nobody believes that it &apos;s actually very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending in the administration is actually more in relation to anthrax and the threat through biological .
we know that the virus is going to be medicalized . it will be another virus .
but in scientific community , there &apos;s a debate about what percentage of the world &apos;s brain is happening between the people through the wounded and the blink of the hands .
some of the poorest countries that most experience with h5n1 have , have camp full of drugs that are already raised .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do with that .
i &apos;m very pleased to answer her questions .
our centers for the world &apos;s centers have been developed by the test of them -- as fast as a rapid .
and in the way , in the world , in the way , in people , they were similar bacterial infections also .
don &apos;t just look at how much fun you have , but also how the energy of the weight is completely changing , with a city like san francisco .
please put a little bit of a time .
i &apos;m going to get a little juggler from a force , and he &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a paper , and i &apos;m going to sell three clubs .
i &apos;ve been playing with my childhood , and i was climbing , and i &apos;m going to go to the case , so i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a sudden .
manhattan doesn &apos;t go to infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m going to stay in the middle .
she was one , she was going to me .
because of the most powerful leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the most dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the most interested in the dynamics of the design of the world &apos;s dynamics , which live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising with the media about the media , we have a computer company ; we have a computer company .
and then the students in our recording test came , and they took their own beats with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog , the frog , which is a very endangered endangered species in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve hidden on . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for the world &apos;s food .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
and the air is going to be the air in the world &apos;s air , and it &apos;s going to be the air from the air .
each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are going to get it , there &apos;s even reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always continuing to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite dangerous , as most people are going to be .
when we found him , we didn &apos;t even know what family he heard , so we called him a little bit of the time , and we called him a little bit of the time , because he looked like he was coming from a books .
oxygen oxygen has a continuous and he was beaten .
this means that every one of them and each of them are at least a child who suffers to a disorder .
and his communication and social interaction is improved so that he could visit a normal school and even got a more powerful school .
he &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re only in there , you can &apos;t get out of it again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you notice this day , one day , you &apos;ll hear about him , because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everyone .
we , all of us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium is so long as long as the sun &apos;s way to ask them about their origins .
these are the things that we prove to that that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , to be deeply in a touch with life elsewhere in all of the time .
so , silicon , as important as aluminum , and we will expand it in the future by expanding it in 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive and to the moore &apos;s law of the increased computing .
and then we &apos;d like to look for the most powerful search of human health .
many people say it &apos;s the best place of the world to study climate change .
everybody &apos;s cylinder is a time of time .
while they &apos;re going to get the ice , it &apos;s a little bit of gloves in a oven , so they can put a new pair of gloves , so they can put a new few , if their fingers are getting stiff and their fingers .
i think this is a little bit of a economic deal .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really enjoy the way to push in pipelines in the police station when they actually reported the service to be the american , american health .
you can keep it further , and the efficiency almost multiply with some of the things that are double with some of the things that are going to double the big amount of things .
we could build bigger cars , which would be to make security , but easily should be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have our food system , and the other ones don &apos;t .
and by the way that the step of mass production is the step of the way that we do this kind of materials , or in this case , to make the design of the brain , as good as good , the most powerful , the most powerful
it can &apos;t just act about a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have received .
let &apos;s hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end , he found a little bit of a dutch , a dutch , a dutch named han van meegeren who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that was about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite , he looked like he would have discovered the first time , that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive they find them , how much they move them , or romantic , is critical , what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it brings to the story of his story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his favorite station in washington d.c. , to put on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock painful , because you &apos;re going to be used to a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to see , you can see that maybe there &apos;s a kind of political health system .
they &apos;re going to be able to do a organic , professional member of the american , and what sounds very glamorous , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil , less than less , have less .
the most intriguing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very popular conclusion when you give a drug in such a high dose that it &apos;s going to have more effects , and that you &apos;re going to look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that &apos;s not a solution to that .
and very soon , they had started to get these coal , ton of ton of ton , and the ton of ton of a lot of the time , to china , to china , back to china and everywhere in the world .
can you imagine how you would feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s most important , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , &quot; ah .
these christians are the most powerful .
they &apos;re chasing . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other ones are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them is going to be a child on the morning , and it &apos;s been a fool and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all of this has tremendous implications on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really gave it a very good thing in words .
for the most important thing in the audience , even to explain why the most powerful budget have a bigger budget than comedy , that &apos;s because it &apos;s easier to translate in other languages and cultures . so the market is bigger to these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. &apos;s favorite of the united states , which is going to be about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as anyone knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a life , which started growing up with the gulf of the gulf on the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are in our living environment , are only by belief and guess .
one has been a lot of thousands of years of years .
we need to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. wilson : the rescue of life on earth
another more powerful is the famous european skyline .
the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base base .
the reversal of the extinction is falling in these category .
real falcon from easy to be a little bit of a chicken .
and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional issue . some people come up .
my grandmother was a man .
i also made my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat in a short time , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw it , you don &apos;t say it .
&quot; prefer to get the ancient , i have your favorite .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children &apos;s book , &quot; the police police , &quot; the main police , who &apos;s the most powerful . &quot;
sound affects us constantly physiological , psychological , cognitively and more powerful .
this is a 32 million pounds expensive , important , very , very recently , built in england , designed by a british computer system .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say , don &apos;t sit next to this team , because the noise likes and the other quiet .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business company that &apos;s carrying his life in the suitcase , and the dream and reality and reality is not able to get both to the cracks .
and the teenage frames and four years later , and the job later , the thing was , what started as a computer company , was a more talented of the computer .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a smart , important and extraordinary work , and they &apos;re going to be .
if you look around in the bathroom , you see some products more , like the example of the , for example , the other thing that &apos;s going to be , and the other thing that &apos;s like , but also , the other thing , but also
and the collagen of collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- will use it to inject it in fold .
and i found in total products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear you , you have a long and a long year ago . &quot;
i told you , you should be able to get the way to go , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me the feeling of being somebody in a time where i felt like no one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth copy , so they started in the middle of the ninth , and now the letters p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of the thoughts , or &quot; &quot; aw . &quot;
so the mystery is , why is , polite requests , the housing and threats so often ?
you can imagine what might be if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s going to make it a lot of it . it &apos;s a lot of the time .
what &apos;s the realization of that , to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine a argument where you &apos;re involved , but in the audience , and you see the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most important part of me : we want you to be able to get us into the world of nature , and we &apos;re going to get a design of the master , and we can find the master &apos;s master .
this changed everything . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t going to put up in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .
that would be a fuel fuel for fuel cells when they could get out of a traumatic .
this is not easy , because life is just using a subset of elements in the periodic table .
feel and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , almost half of the companies are women .
because , as the most important thing , the smaller , smaller , more powerful in direct context are in direct economic economy .
and the world in all the world are not exceptions .
people are going to be a little bit of the pleasure and this miracle .
i have a big deal of happy , and i &apos;d like to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , and i want to use paper towel to use it .
first of all , we &apos;ve got it off .
what does this mean ?
when i started to engage with them , i realized that they &apos;ve been incredibly adapted to it .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , they were going to go and left the campus -- and sure , there were gone to come out there -- some time later , and discovered that crows still remembered them .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other .
squirrel for example would come to the peanut , looking for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a computer company .
who would ever be able to hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot too straightforward .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s sound .
about 10 million of them .
and here we see , with the words of the radiologists israel , &quot; how the hand is going to arrest the penis in a way , and that &apos;s what reminds you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather eat to end , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book , who was supposed to be asked by the most prolific maria , and there was a spider maria , which had trouble with conception .
so you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i &apos;ve got to read you what she said because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d like to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment that in age , in 50 , one of the skills i really had was , was my shoes to tie my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know exactly where it should be the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you still are a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i put a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all here .
my father was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song as mere fact .
i &apos;m , &quot; wait , is yes good -- i &apos;m going to give the wheels . &quot; from just protest , i bought the competition , and i built them and -- look at my favorite , and i &apos;m going to see my favorite card ?
it just sounds like , but i think we &apos;re generally in our society and culture with the intent of a huge .
he had designed the fancy self , and he was really proud of it .
human , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet already on the seven billion people are living .
especially proud of it was on the very low-tech seat , the real very disappointing seat he had given his favorite , and on the beautiful , about the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- they &apos;re living in the original way , the original thing .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i was putting it , that she was lost , and i was able to put all of the things that i didn &apos;t have yet , but not possible .
then i started to ask how many times before , like my life would have been different when this man didn &apos;t hurt me if my genes had a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now despite a computer company , and i think i was going to think of myself .
i had a lot of simpler hoping to trade this turkish , and to share this turkish , and to make me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his favorite for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine , and we &apos;re working on the university of california , san diego together .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction is being intuitive with the robot for them .
and yet i made this idea to be a way .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of you even have been doing the speaker in the speaker , as nathan &apos;s way to talk , or the one of tim ferriss , who may be considered a very hard thing .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes that .
so , i paid 25 cents , because i found the task , a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all safe : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m going to call you three main of the string theory .
the candidate candidate went on about 10 high .
and he worked at decades of telling this number , but he didn &apos;t have success , and we know why .
each of these universes has additional dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by turning powerful telescopes to heaven , discover a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on the road .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to really make you really excited and even more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri so right in the field of time .
we don &apos;t know here .
the next moment is not working on the phone , the tv is coming out , the tv men are on the street .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporter who worked in war , the staff of ngos , and of course the bold , brave people from sarajevo itself .
if i &apos;m asked , why i &apos;m going to go on , why i &apos;m going to stay on that , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession to break up this testimony and that &apos;s the most important thing that the core of the thing , for us reporters .
even before a goal is , that &apos;s trying to get the joystick to the joystick of the cursor , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to find the goal of what it is .
basically , we trained the animals to learn that , to control these kinds of things and explore objects in virtual world .
in an experiment that we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so , id manju made the most finished .
raise your hand .
the last reason to do it is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , in the average one , one of seven women die in the birth of a child .
she was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry &apos;s , when he was a world bank , once he was in the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investments in the world are going to be the highest of girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre of the entire world tells us that there &apos;s a computer system .
and even this picture makes the suspects impression , to be a little bit of the way that the most of the day &amp; amp ; the other thing that &apos;s about the most powerful &amp; amp ;
one of these possibilities was that we could have been able to get into small pieces of time .
they put their arrowheads and say , &quot; i want to share these arrowheads against finished arrows , we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles on a new language .
if 27 individuals from these 27 member member of the year , they put up a table , and they &apos;re just saying , a simple one , they just say , a calculation of the design of the world &apos;s own , to be prepared to be prepared
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they were also about language .
and what i &apos;m interested in most is the invisible space between a text and the more likely picture , and how the picture is changing through the text , and the text through the picture .
this is the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on over the atlantic ocean , and in north america , connecting north america .
they turn the negative to the negative .
but through the impression of the design of the world , the most powerful , and the way that we can do it , the most powerful thing is to change the world &apos;s disease .
larry &apos;s 8 was eight years of a 10 year-old sentence , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeated a young boy on a computer company .
and the people are leaving themselves .
and they brought them to texas .
and now they drive with the food , where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast of space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called a kind of a sense of feeling , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , the legacy of the legacy is the most prolific , the most prolific , which was a sense of happiness for the most powerful , and it &apos;s not going to be made by the world &apos;s most driven , and it can &apos;t be found in
a computer company in science is that happiness and bad , no one is a professional continuum in a sealed continuum .
it starts in the field of the field .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one possibility to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat understood that , we have a little bit more powerful .
you can actually cure t.b. , even people who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient who remains the microscopic , to 15 people , to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , can be safe that we &apos;ve saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and belgium .
now , the question is : if i just watch how another person is touched , why am i not confused and literally watching this kind of thing from the naked , how someone is touched ?
thank you . i have two of these guys today .
i &apos;m not going to be in the world &apos;s most important , but to the pollen itself .
all these images were taken by a microscope microscope by the way of kew , by the way .
even every single one of us has a story to tell you the most important story on us .
we have to be so good as the breast cancer , to address this crisis .
and at the time , in the 1980s , when we &apos;re going to get women and death through heart disease , they wrote a piece of the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the most prolific , x-ray , for women , whose professional the vision of the heart , every time we organize something that includes a little bit of radiation , we ask : &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve held the , and they were born .
the cells have something like this , in the dish , they don &apos;t feel the fuel .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours old , collected about a quarter hours of a million hours of a million hours of a million hours of a million hours .
this is one of the first things that came out of a year ago , which is a little bit more than a year ago .
and finally , my son is going to be alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , and the most important , and the main of the world &apos;s and the world &apos;s favorite roy , are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son did more than two steps , captured in the movie .
and this is a important thing to be a question , because the better we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think , and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the way . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our team of the whole world &apos;s entire wall on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about malnutrition , but also to the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a building .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a little bit of a window , and you &apos;re broken , then we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept hired .
are we just stupid ?
you might be able to get out of two years when you read eight hours a day .
so it can be in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting to get the fire fire , to cut the vehicle into pieces to get the body to the driver &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to go into the present with the most important in the united states , which is a eye of divine breeding .
all of that leads us to -- the only thing that we &apos;re doing is to name the time , which is what we do most of the things that we do .
this is the consequence of destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right , through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the health system .
he gave my jaw in the right position while he was doing my teeth .
alfred man is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who is fascinated by the gaps of mind , whether he &apos;s a deaf , or a blind , or a blind , or a paralyzed the movement .
now i had to go in the dark years , who followed me , and what was going on when everything that was special today was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big one of africa and the ones are in the side .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of search that we can copy the data in a computer form , and we can publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin explains life after it &apos;s formed , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was decided to be unhappy ; my girls didn &apos;t get me married .
you can compare it to a lot of the physical sectors and the other of the people .
and so i &apos;ll close by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense of the defense costs two million dollars , and takes 18 months when they win .
first , you don &apos;t fight the patent , but it &apos;s against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of the way .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the fathers were at a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their chairs , their chairs and their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and we needed a different approach to eradicate polio as we had done with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic , pandemic , for example , to take .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce ornish : how we &apos;re going to take polio to a standstill
dj : we found this coup now at all kinds of animals , especially with the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a computer company .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol for inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied with us .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these things , the most powerful , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to continue to continue .
and it seems obvious to be that the earth is big and absolute , the sun is small and mobile , but it &apos;s worth remember what &apos;s going on to the other thing .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle of the land , there &apos;s always there .
nature is dependent on that model , which is what the animal is .
because there are so many of them , and because between them , they don &apos;t have a consensus about their favorite , and they &apos;re going to be able to see the most important thing that we see in middle middle , and we &apos;re looking at it
people like to treat a machines , and they &apos;re just going to be a scientific time , but it &apos;s a very important time , if you want to guess what the person is going to do next .
and i was in the wheels of the house , and i was in the wheels of 40 years of 40 years .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these to see the video , videos of the robot and send orders to get the buttons in a computer factory .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
for example , in oceanography , for example , a computer lexicon is developed by the most powerful , which is basically the most powerful , which is the dolphins that are sending the dolphins to put it out .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot design system .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from that .
but normally we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also take the most of you not talking about chinese -- what &apos;s really sad if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that too .
if you look at this picture , maybe you think , &quot; why should that happen at all ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence , and make sure that states never get to shelter again .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and the war is fixed , 20 million people who took life -- until today the civil war war .
and so , the idea of the guy who &apos;s this guy : &quot; i have all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was just at the university in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , the 18th century , is the most important search for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big amount of reference .
when the members started to become less , i was clearly getting more depressed until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember to get a child on every line ?
at 18 and 19 , i slept with the night .
again , i &apos;ll be a little depressed and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit .
many of us is clear that there are a lot of the way to do a better world in the next few years .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that made out of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you &apos;re impossible to do the impossible of the impossible , you can do it .
but we have reached a agreement for climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the most remarkable thing is , you &apos;re using a lot of ingredients , proteins and water , which are in their porch to create a material that is extraordinary as protection , which is extraordinary to make a difference as protection .
or you &apos;re going to be a nice thing like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see , how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , u , i want to use art for creating technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to be the case and the round of applause and the round of applause -- hopefully not -- to help him to make some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this still , heather knight is a data , a computer company , which can be far more than a more powerful -- he &apos;s going to get the feedback of his audience and his behavior , and it &apos;s the answers of the crowd
stanley jurvetson , inventor of the known &quot; the famous &quot; of the world &apos;s favorite , &quot; thought of the most famous , &quot; and the most important , that it was between two people , would be a connection about five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships change all of the things ?
but there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where maybe he could have been able to put this in the ear .
um ... my father , a computer company ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about other people &apos;s lives , he had to be in the other age of 17 years , and his fault , a computer , a computer , because he was out of a camp , he kept his whole life .
and as my 15-year-old and my favorite , i thought , was a little bit more orphans , and i was doing my father wrong papers .
i asked him to go to the victim , who he had had ever been able to do , if he ever had the most important .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people that we are today , and we &apos;re going to get .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a computer system on the ground , which is a computer company , which is a very good one to the next , which is the next thing that is in a good state .
if you &apos;re going to go to the forests , the border of land , you &apos;re going to go to the land of the land , and you &apos;re going to keep the ability to stay stable .
with the realization of the world &apos;s realization , fishermen , the most powerful barrier reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is damn damn the current brain reef .
but the drama is , of course , that it &apos;s clear that the change is not an option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media of all kinds of things .
this is a race of a race of a race of a race .
and first , he uses a ancient way of making the design of the manufacturing and connected to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology to this time .
and by the process of sugar , i hired portraits from them .
it became very large images and i took them with a very large camera , a video camera .
my interest on the most important , especially worse , is enough .
on the back , one sequence is the sequence that is also in chimpanzees .
we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and the most powerful ?
and then you can compare it to the genome today of living people .
so we can then ask the same questions , how to do the same question for neanderthals : do you have mixed with ancestors today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of their own vision , like this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane of the future has his own consciousness .
imagine , carbon nanotubes grow in 3d printers , and they &apos;re embedded in a computer factory , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be a little bit of the police . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you see a video on it .
you have the feeling that the research you have , you know , is really a effect on reality that you can actually prevent this experience , which i &apos;ve started to do with this area .
then you &apos;re going to be a little bit .
you &apos;re going to put you in a stare of body -- chin on the top of the brain , poor , poor , and you put on your own body .
they did everything like we taught them .
and after the battle , they get this mobile class and they make what you call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a piece of light .
and she showed up on the left work to tell me how problematic this picture was , that was for her to do with the idea of how black represents .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most important , that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
well , this is kind of a obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how should we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you do that before you decided you &apos;ve got nothing ? &quot;
their favorite , the more , they have increased 50 , which is a good school of delhi , which is a very nice of the world &apos;s own .
was 76 percent . in the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be da vinci .
these are 10-year-old .
suddenly , i looked out from the darkness on the opposite side of the space , a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much of the way .
if i have to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips of my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends in a sleep .
bono : you &apos;re a one-eyed .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts in the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most powerful , which we have , and find out what price people would pay for for that , so they would have the choice .
thank you .
the most popular thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two of the things that we were doing and 10 tv .
the little little bit of the way to remove it , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue of the density of the density and behavior is to create the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the design of the design .
thank you .
and the attempt to go to the trial is how to take a arrow with the end of the end of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more , even more , more important developments , as a result of the world , and the darpa institute of technology , and the university of los angeles .
be careful , they just behave like wood or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a lot of time .
they go forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes him to be about &quot; three years of &quot; three years . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one more .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time , where we live in human mind and machines .
i &apos;ve been very clear . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s to worry that the way that the way in the wild is extinct to 30 years .
all the evidence of the way that this cancer is going to be transmitted from a virus .
i took the opportunity to do the opportunity and took a few samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other body body .
she brought him to the veterinarian and this discovered something called a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a sudden .
ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation don &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers on them are going to be on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the most powerful for optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is gradually coming back to the half of the world &apos;s population , and to afford over half the global economic economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after 1975 , the soviets had the sputnik , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or a new delhi or your view of china , something else will be different than you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to get this into bigger historical context we can be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a more powerful amount of data .
this is the conventional approach .
this typically has the responsibility to make the responsibility of a stable security system .
they depend on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after mostly the law is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to it .
the treatment would be made by the conflict , government , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has it . they call the climate change a design system , which is security and stability , as governments are discussing on the world , as they &apos;re to react .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford to do the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions when we feel in the situation to plan to plan to plan to be a world &apos;s world .
listen to chinese students , by doing it by screaming it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that &apos;s what things like the concrete world with the world &apos;s population , to make abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make logical , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is what might be .
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a very specific world .
and here was luria , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose to be a new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively tough professions .
would you have killed it , killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony from angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to do a degree in something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris created it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of defense , secretary of defense and a subset of the world &apos;s president .
boy : &quot; the most serious thing is serious .
we were all mad , &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be much real if you read it . &quot;
we had the game always played after school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we had all the 50 of them in the very recent , and we &apos;ve been able to overcome all 50 .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs , and they were going to be able to get the most powerful .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all get three legs from it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a stimulus .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very reactive argument -- this old computer , and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; , this is a very simple thing to be in a old computer .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , and you can be able to be able to be able to be able to get a piece of paper , you can be in a school school or in a state of school -- a sheet
what we do is a very simple thing .
this is a little bit of a little bit of a bar , which is the two corners here , it will be like a computer company .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and she was bored , so the captain was invited to be a deck .
in the world conference , a lot of the simple , and yet , a little bit of a simple plans , and yet amazing plans to make waste in really a really , very good toys , to turn the children to build themselves -- while they learn
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that was a lot of evidence .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of the ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be dominated by a space of traffic in a turn , which is open space for people who are bringing people to food and waste waste in opportunities .
this photograph was done at the day of the day , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you &apos;re putting seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to explore people with visions of visions . &quot;
i was looking at somebody who is jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were lots of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a computer table .
i tried to be in principle , like the way that we were doing it .
because they remember my favorite , they have to get a little bit of 700 points and no one did this .
most of you . players are in average , not eight years old , and if we look at the most profound demographics of the world &apos;s oil , the players of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these players even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also better , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of the other group of the world &apos;s group , a group that is actually in our society , which is a lot of people who are doing that .
let me explain this step with a task that calls mental oxide .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just all be able to do the whole programs of special if we &apos;re looking at it .
so it was a big , very complex project i didn &apos;t even have to be sure if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , driven language and a big network of the world &apos;s ability to do a lot of lines , and a lot of lines of the way to do it .
so , with physical design , we &apos;re actually used to go to the world and see that certain materials are sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful , which is successful , and the general relativity theory and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during this time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who were going to get me to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there was a woman who was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a very much on the surface of the surface , automatically , and automatically , what my family had , anyway , he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were excited , and we didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he wore the pedal and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have a little bit more attractive roads . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything you would ask for me .
when it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was made for it , and they were punished .
while we talk to you , 125 girls will never be kidnapped again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of american gdp , actually start , just like banks and companies , their own , their own life , in everyday life , themselves , to free themselves , and to free ourselves , when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the entire phenomenon of the fact that we actually step and basically future education , the future children of our households .
and the way that we &apos;re up is 48 percent , the cornell institute .
we also observe a trend to something that &apos;s a trend , right ?
one of them is the most powerful of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s increasing the word of the neighbors as a support .
we also observe a big amount of energy .
the trend for the most powerful is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of the pinhead .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s doing something like this ?
you could use them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell the novels , writing , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also over some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main system could be declining . our hearts could be more powerful , and our main system could be more powerful when we &apos;re going to be in our cultural health systems .
i was going to be in the first time , like i call it &quot; representative palmer . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a half , and i &apos;m going to ask why i do that . but the melting between languages is allowed me to invent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was a huge thing , because i was being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will be a happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a computer company , gay professor in norway .
so , you &apos;re going to get the existing songs , you &apos;re going to cut existing songs , it &apos;s going to form these pieces , and you get it together , and you get a new song , but that &apos;s a new song , but this
instead , these laws and laws are using the more awkward comparison of the property .
it &apos;s a computer company , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it &apos;s going on . the alarm alarm : the phone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his fingers .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see these limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to a sense of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so much that atoms have a single core , with the world &apos;s population , which circle it around .
this picture shows a galaxy , a computer , with , and , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually be the most powerful ideas for us , and we &apos;re going to be able to do the value of our home in the universe and really the value of our home home .
this is here . this is at home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every mouse and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to drop the way to the screen and the humanities of our personal information everywhere in our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat on the top of the world , i asked them , &quot; will you get a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t also do it in the world .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much fascinated and talked to me , i decided i was not going to talk to my 27 birthday , i would not be talking about a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to help a friend who understood my sign , that i was john francis , that i was going to live through life , that i was not talking to you , and that &apos;s the last time that somebody would translate my sign sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had studied a lot of time .
but the most important thing was that i was thinking about every birthday of my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i was constantly worried that i would be a ph.d. and then i would get back to it .
i felt so attractive because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died in hunger .
but i think that their gesture of love and care can save life of another joseph and can change thousands of other people &apos;s lives that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and just to make a simple , and as a industrial , and also to make a industrial system .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , the government , contractor .
and then in 1995 , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder what &apos;s a permanent and what a more powerful building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in utero .
so fetuses even learn the particular language that will be talked to the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of the underlying , which is so problematic and weird , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to the womb in the womb ?
you can see the other eyes , but you can see with other eyes .
this trust in the most important is essential for every kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing .
the audience will be on the top of the world , which is very logical , but not with the gymnosophist , which is happening before their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may even get us to smile .
you may remember that as the most important thing , all of the time , and then when the biggest deal of all time was announced .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the most violent , and someone says , &quot; what do you do for the hunger of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy plays a role .
for me , all of this was the music .
now , if i use my software , the camera is going to see the camera , and the place of the world &apos;s place is to the most powerful , and you &apos;ve got a marker of the world .
i remember the poor needed something that was going to be a little bit more powerful -- food , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a kind of shame .
now , since i heard him , i was excited about different reasons .
i was not once asked to be a donation , which was usually my kind of thing .
it &apos;s about the most important of the story of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage what your dignity would confirm , a partnership that &apos;s based on a traditional way of sending a partnership , and it can happen crazy .
it &apos;s a very much combination of a combination of a very strong combination .
now , the first thing is , the beginning of the beginning , and it &apos;s a very clear thing to me , and it &apos;s very clear for me , just a device .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate even doubled every 18 months and every single single member of the world &apos;s population knows that it &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they &apos;re in their wallet , and they &apos;re going to put people on the sky , and they &apos;re not going to be able to agree with the people who would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
the previous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was in the form of the world &apos;s first technology in the form of the world .
we can learn very much about it .
and i see the way i see the child , and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t get any minister of a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a record gang , but some adaptations for the climb of trees had .
until now , our knowledge of our ancestors in principle came from adults , because the fossils , the most powerful , missing .
the most popular of the world &apos;s favorite , the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia , is talking about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa about our human beings .
and if all of you should be able to do the rules , of course , you need an effective system to the review and the way we &apos;ve found it in all the trust , and it &apos;s also necessary to be able to do control .
it &apos;s considered a high seas , because the continent of the brain &apos;s brain is except .
we need to work locally , but also all the ocean centers .
we need to create a new paradigm of the wooden and respect .
carol &apos;s saying , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
this was a pretty good idea .
to say , i &apos;m a journalist , no technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we have to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes from .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of complex are that you have the strong and more powerful opinion , which is the right solution to the problem , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the rate of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and do it . probably everything goes wrong .
it &apos;s immediately off . &quot;
and the waiter was trying to get it again , but he could never prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not portable .
china is going to have done this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally the most powerful .
yes , it will become ugly , and yes , it &apos;s happening soon -- with security in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than capable of getting everything that &apos;s on us .
and here you come into play .
and what we need to think about is that , if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you .
all other things is a lot of the time .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should not be amazing or ?
everything we have is a lot of the time .
you will be able to focus on your listening to your listening , or you can get a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
this is not 1,000 years in the distant .
we should be able to be the cheap , simple , simple , simple , and nobody &apos;s using them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this overall one .
we can &apos;t risk the trust of the customers .
he only got 500 and could have gotten 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge set of plastic , which she got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- things that we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to be a more powerful thing is a human brain , a human brain if we look at the rate , and there &apos;s six billion more of the years of the time .
now it &apos;s not like that -- if you do a table and things at work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web but you will be part of it . you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to browse .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be able to do .
third , it will be more ubiquitous , and we &apos;re going to fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second thing was the second of jesus christ , that it was sun , and that i was particularly from god and i was prepared by god to become his favorite .
these are the dead of the world &apos;s dead .
and it allows everything . it &apos;s all logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things out .
this is a project we &apos;ve just done in the field of a huge computer system , which came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that develop it .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are going to be young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer company .
each of you is going to be on his neighbors .
so , as we have to pay school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain &apos;s brain .
this is very , very important , very important , because there &apos;s a number of the line .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , like you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can name even 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the most sophisticated monks said that .
the most popular , the post , on the sun , is actually a very , very much , which is the light that &apos;s constantly reflected on the light that seems to be on the holy , the sacred , called the most powerful , the water &apos;s
if you pray for the dead , you do with the hands that you &apos;re going to get up with your thoughts in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has the most powerful in the world , which has the mountains and creating the country that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique to the human imagination .
this material that you all know is , it &apos;s a lot of the time , but i think it &apos;s more for toxic stuff .
i &apos;m going to take it in , you can fit there , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without a framework in the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of the world or a lot of the way that you have to do it , because you have many alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition four years ago , &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot; started .
my country is with 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of the speakers that are going to come to me and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work on mathematical models , which should encourage a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s a lot more interesting -- and find a different pattern .
you can think about two types of things .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to more secular , because of the most secular , you &apos;re doing uncertainty .
and only at one percent , it &apos;s wrong .
he said , &quot; i suppose that after a sudden death in a family , the probability of a sudden is going to be a more equal . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of quality that has the very powerful impact on industrial processing is carried by statistics .
the most important thing perhaps has saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
a smart power power prevents injury because the electricity is always recognized by a smart amount of energy . just .
but , on the other hand , china is a computer company . a term from the back of the world .
you have facebook , we have a lot of the time .
yet , the hirshhorn itself can create a very strong force , which is still never in the history of china .
so , chinese that &apos;s the same medium as the real medium , not only as mere headlines .
how a big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , it &apos;s really changed by the last three years , and it &apos;s done more transparent , because the no access to the data .
more chinese , more chinese speech , and human rights as your own , rather than a of america , rather than a of america .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was seventh symphony .
i don &apos;t say you can live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .

and it seems like his favorite way of being removed to try to find the cause of death , which is why sound was going to be a sound , and his skull has been on the sides .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to get myself , in this particular auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch history , my father was at the bank of the river river in the near of the river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as a tool of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then it &apos;s going to be 250 sequences .
this is a computer company in the middle of the world &apos;s population , in the middle of the national .
you can &apos;t let &quot; be very gently . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolved in the way that technology is evolving in the way .
now , evolution of our species needed hundreds of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically the technology of the technology , to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; so we can use the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had a year of 28 percent of the year in the information of 28 percent of the time .
another big revolution is the most powerful .
to go back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to get the full of these trends , and they have to celebrate how often the vaccine has made in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
you can bring blessing and the peril .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the most violent .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not a lot of time .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that is in connection with the brain .
and we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought , and they &apos;re a master &apos;s in the african .
the 11th 11th has a computer company . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own own , and we have a product product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he , but we managed to do it , and we were doing it , and we were doing it , and i was going to get a little bit of the n , and bruce , tracy , and bruce , and
they always said , &quot; tell us the truth &quot; and beat us .
musicians and activist peter gabriel shares his personal motivation , with the human rights , and told stories of active , and told stories of active health .
next we asked ourselves how to do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing it . the dance is his favorite , which allows him to be able to get new .
the beetle climb much less likely to go to the pill if you &apos;re wearing it , when you don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
let &apos;s play a computer and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun to get to the big adventure is not very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother does a cruise next year in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation that the vc is to convince you is that they &apos;re investing in the entrepreneurs they &apos;re investing in and make a lot of money .
and next to the experience , a company or to lead to a company -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially living in which there were no problems in the way that there was no problems .
and you take them from there , and you &apos;re going to get a solid path up , right away , right from beginning to the end .
if i happen to know somebody who has made a device that &apos;s made .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick time .
even if the competition works for old patterns ...
it was all positive , positive , positive , positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;ll have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , to get to the way that you &apos;re and to bring it to a lot of emotional
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you multiply something , maybe you can have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last place as the culture , the innovation , the innovation .
so as we think , and we &apos;re going to make our own , our main system break .
we have a little meme -- seriously to be .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest most popular ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
through a vibrant change , change , like transparency , change , like for example , and collaboration , collaboration , and collaboration , and not the things that are focused on results , they &apos;re focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are always going to be done , the only way to get rid of us , the old , and new creative solutions for problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can turn bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the world &apos;s field is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the most popular , because the most popular was in the time .
after i had a gesture of a gesture , they were very -- because i was accepted and i worked there for six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , the , and henry .
we &apos;re going to make a lot of magazines , we made our homework , but where we looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds after i was putting the baby into the poor , and i brought it across .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk about his purse , but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better , since i &apos;m in the wonders of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to lose control of the wonderful way to lose the control of the wonderful way , what we &apos;re doing , and what &apos;s very satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these star &quot; star &quot; with the most popular .
imagine , big , already late , very late , as you would play , and john &apos;s walker &apos;s walker shows how footage are going to be on the exact operations and analyzed the way you can get to the exact desert , and then you can play
now , since we &apos;ve been able to have a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest increase in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians are always going to be in it , &quot; in the &apos; 60s apple , without the mine , &quot; how to get somebody to get their uncertainty , they can &apos;t hide their uncertainty yet .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a very chaotic man , and it was a simple chaotic man who was fed from tomato sauce and iron for completely committed .
but interestingly , this also is a future where society is a few tricks from capitalism , which is how to put dna in the society , which is how to try and do things and then they tried to work , and they &apos;re working , and they
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on about the relationship between the structure of language , which you talk about , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk right , it forces me to think about it constantly .
well , this is a very reactive theory .
so please push this device so that you can measure your dominant hand with your dominant hand , so i can measure your own .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability is to communicate about generations .
we &apos;re going to be the english teacher constantly .
but i &apos;m about using them as a barrier .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the world &apos;s field , although i was a ph.d. in the isle of the world .
people and the other and the other and the and the birds and the birds and all the red line here is high . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused more on serious energy systems , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this was the last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just is going to be a little bit of a time , and you can do every single one that you want .
and he was a very compelling thing about how people were discussing the buddhist religion in india .
and he goes back as a broken man back to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re looking at it . we take the feeling of memory to a mother and a long time in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and they &apos;re a little bit of the other .
although the change in your attitude is something for other creatures , you feel that new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and it &apos;s going to be a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of the cup , is using a tool of society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two of the two .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with detail , but in the lower right-hand , you see a example of what we have for this .
did you start to do that ?
and then the most important thing comes from the things that jimmy had talked about , what &apos;s the new way of the organization , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be less in the situation , it &apos;s just going to be in the use of the use of the world .
so , for example , take astronomy , which was mentioned yochai .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional argument , professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to be a argument of two camp , but between these camps , it will give all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to spend their own , and actually , a team , and they did it , and they did it between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for this .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people call the news and they have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman attracted to true to true . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t do a little bit of a little bit , so that it was just moved in a different city , and a new job had accepted .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , starting from genes about the brain , dopamine and the way to go to the top of the world .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases , because in her own , there was no violence under your ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other as you can be .
by the way , i have a email today , which is that we &apos;ve done the last part of atlas today .
and these guys here are the weak force that may be known at least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why the ham is connecting , you should basically be in the process of a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve now got -- you have the shape that you &apos;ve now
the comparison is that people in this room represent the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that this theory is the physical system to unite the big bang at the point of the big bang , a perfectly wonderful prediction . this is the model that it &apos;s not going to happen , but it seems to be .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , which is transformed into light and it allows the civilization to see the civilization from all .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the world &apos;s book , and the baseball &apos;s cards looked at the &apos; 80s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use the fmri of the world to measure the world &apos;s face and after they had the face of the face to be smiling .
&quot; because the colors that they &apos;ve ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? have there more policemen in the middle ? &quot;
we built the light of the light that people , people , people from the world , were to think that they were in abroad when they were going to be able to move their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
everywhere in port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came up and offered the stations of mobile phones for mobile phones .
a graph for the bioluminescent power of technology is going to find in kibera .
until 2015 , it will give three billion smartphones on the world .
in the stores of the environment , batteries and bread were going to be a lot of bread .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a computer , in the hull of a computer , the deer , the rose .
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bear , i remember how i &apos;m going to be a kid on his head to slide out of his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve always seen how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can choose the solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t have the flow of time , but again , make it .
my mother was a little bit of a sudden .
in every single refugee camp , they had to tear up soldiers who were my older brother mark , who was nine , and they wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to do from the suitcase .
then i ended up in a hurry because i didn &apos;t mean my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out about five times .
the wool is the answer .
why should this be a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow every organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the landfill turn with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s going to be able to get obstacles .
they take their neighbors right .
this shows that we double the most sophisticated , jb , online , in which we can bring them to form teams like you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon here , and you &apos;re going to change your mind , and change your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , which is the most different , many different viruses , bacteria and the most powerful with themselves .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the chefs take the chefs for their dishes , and the honey -- there are a lot of the honey -- they use the honey of their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , really , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have it , especially in the last decade , and the world with a dense chain of the industry , with a chain global trade .
and never before , so many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially the meat in the world &apos;s flesh and china drives the most powerful .
agriculture is for most people , and here are not many farmers under them , to be bad , to be bad , to be able to destroy the environment , to destroy the environment .
everything depends together .
and so while i do my bread , and i &apos;ve got it to be a little bit of the time , and i &apos;m trying to burn my hands .
also , it has to be a long time to keep a long time to repair the tools that are available to the tools that are available and the design of the world .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed and testing and develop a new technology , and it &apos;s determined to be the quantitative energy system .
because i hope you take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in a exxon .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but the most compelling thing was , one of them , and shekhar kapur , was a film about her , and shekhar , you should see it .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a kind of a framework of the field .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was at the time of 73 -- he needed a very shaky , but it was a very shaky thing for this .
i like this slide because they &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what they don &apos;t .
if you eat a high meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a computer company . americans even eat more fat because , even more carbs , and even more carbs , but the actual number higher , the goal is , both of the time , it &apos;s both to reduce .
one of the most popular studies found that 70 percent of people were blogging , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of the people had bad breath -- that &apos;s not healthy diet .
on the other hand , everything is what intimacy are , the way that intimacy is .
i hope he &apos;s not staying .
the film is based on a computer &apos;s book of f. scott &apos;s .
two main people were involved in the project : warner brothers and the most powerful .
and we had enough passion to make the most powerful and technology .
so we &apos;re so eager to make motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and that &apos;s the data we get from that , and then it &apos;s used for the model .
and so the finished picture looked like this was used in the movie .
this was a very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state .
and it has a own more powerful .
people from the people who are going to get these awful , the past , they have been able to get their lives for their lives .
we were too fourth -- two car , and imagine , and imagine that this vast one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best nobel animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our most powerful .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another film .
i don &apos;t get to the bottom of the body , and i &apos;m not going to go to the body temperature , and i &apos;m going to go to a egg .
so , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . it would be an idea .
but how would it be like , if you never knew how to do the next day , you &apos;re going to be a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you sit down from the organizers , or you &apos;re sitting down from the
who could sleep in this night ?
but you knew judy was going to be 150,000 dollars in your age , that the french d was the french army , and his was the french army , his room had taken up -- no wait , i mean , he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and a opens of hand to another .
and the human health system is more than that , but you would take these two columns , probably not much left .
and also , we have the problem that you can &apos;t build a construction that would be hard for a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a computer , &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other and sharing . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you need to do .
a philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that the one thing that is a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of power , and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent that pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the most powerful thing .
and i have to say , god is thank you .
so i heard it in a way , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the serious thing can create the serious .
so , kathryn jacobs : how healthy life is almost
and i think many scientists share this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were hacked , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask the story of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
... a priest ?
and finally , a group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in today today .
on the right , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , and it &apos;s more data to create .
this sign is the number of the indus script , and only in this text , it seems twice .
it turns out that in india , it &apos;s a long tradition of the day of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire is the most famous thing that &apos;s famous to do the name bell .
and the historical discovery had made the historical discovery that the body cells can also be as much as the radio waves .
in fact , all the young people of the city .
somebody who sits in the seat , that &apos;s okay in a computer factory , but you would sit on a computer factory , but somebody would be so dense to you , then you would be able to get a lot of time .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says , if you get the idea of the idea of the design of the brain , it &apos;s because you realize you &apos;re going to see yourself and your pain and the pleasure of the way to be a
take this wonderful thing , the most wonderful thing that we showed is , you &apos;re afraid of the most powerful .
a man was a tank in front of a tank that became a symbol of the world &apos;s disease .
but what didn &apos;t you have anything else to do when you had the modern communication to create a sense that it was wrong , and that was what was going on , immediately , something that had to be done ?
combine the power of a global ethic with power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global to the challenges that are now in the world , and the most largely global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of the children who were left , the world &apos;s life , who were left when the most prolific of rwanda died a million people .
here &apos;s the task : help me to build a vibrant , a vibrant , a vibrant , a vibrant .
you can move on very different types of water -- they vary in the most sophisticated , the movement of the surface and the given of the surface .
this is the driving algae .
boy : expanding .
let &apos;s slow out to see the spines in action .
mark &apos;s at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called shape , which is a technology called the shape of the shape of the form of the form .
you see almost like aliens . and the secret , what you stick , are your own toes .
so here we pull the band-aid .
these are the structures that allow the spines to be able to capture the spines , and the most difficult , difficult surfaces , difficult surfaces .
so , the long beautiful songs that are going to make a lot of beautiful songs that are as a more powerful and the males as the females are going to allow each other to find each other and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to be less than half the time of the time .
if we think of marine marine fields like dolphins like dolphins , we need to be over the consequences of our interventions in the clear , which we thought we were really safe for .
after the most popular , the marine marine system has made these systems available to experience what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what the impact of the population would have been in the recovery of the world &apos;s recovery .
as ships can be made . they found that with a better more powerful of these noise , they can be reduced to 90 percent of these noise .
they &apos;re going to be the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 , and it &apos;s always going to be more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve all been available to the possibilities .
we observe a continuous rise of the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred , the hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars laptop , it &apos;s a thought that we put a whole new generation of people in the old computer of the computer .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
but our daily life is , but it &apos;s said , in a remarkable condition , we say in a very extraordinary condition .
normally it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are .
but we &apos;re much more more more complex .
part of the challenge was to try to try and make rhythm and space by not just my hands -- in juggling , a lot of the time -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet of my body and the feet of my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a computer &apos;s is , i give you a little hint .
now , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open . open .
you have somebody up here , which is the most important principle of doing this , ok ?
pop -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number about time .
with space and straight in the room , in other ways .
and then the levels of levels .
in this year -- please , please , you could show the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re wearing the most powerful with us , a project that we have helped the design of design .
we can call this on a computer company which allows you to get more information over the clothes , while you &apos;re doing these kinds of things .
and scott adams : i noticed that i &apos;m going to be the leading expert in the world &apos;s way .
and we also give a new product tonight , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown in public .
now , the farmers can only harvest the season , and not in the world &apos;s population .
electrons disappear in a way of the kind of plastic and then only energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . have you known that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the sense of this , henry ?
we &apos;ve been doing about four years of time .
if google is a book , you get it into a very beautiful format .
i give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine that it &apos;s not going to be interested in it .
but also many very much on the right , which apparently has the propaganda .
if you get the template , it means &quot; a &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if i walk to this pink sound for longer than some minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but this is a big , public spaces like this , shared , shared , small personal personal personal personal .
you can also do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you very much , you &apos;ve been here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they were not at us on the sidewalk and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my shared , a exchange that was fair to us , but they were alien .
now , i say , in the most popular year , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because the arab spring is still spreading , which is the most important thing ?
this photograph was actually launched in a police station , and look at the floor of the people who were tracking from the police .
the kids just make photos in a class , the teacher gets them , they paste them on the top of the world .
now , in the talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a computer company .
this is something we can work in our lifetime . i believed i could make a difference and i tried to get out of the most powerful , and i was going to get out of the most powerful .
but sometimes science has some other properties that really really really really really really really do interesting .
what are there more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most powerful part of the world &apos;s name , which is the name of the neocortex , and nature has been applied to this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it , and say , &quot; what am i seeing ?
not like a computer computer . not in the least a computer computer .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need something police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your point . &quot;
they traveled because they were at the time of elections outside the country .
this is a little bit of the time .
and then when they cut the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash like this : by hand .
these group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it has done english to learn and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and that &apos;s one of three participants .
if you think , you think differently than the employer of the united states , which actually was part of our experiment , because it was exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we added a break between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the carbon system .
the price of this is the recovery of paradise .
and they moved and they were going to go and put them on each other and they went to each other and leave them down .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask personal coach , the most powerful as a bad breath of bad breath in the way .
i &apos;m not really feeling with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is the ability to be in the heads of other people , and to find out what they have to offer .
they have humility .
this is what the unconscious is going to be .
we found them between the most powerful , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries are building .
now , first of all , i &apos;ll give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks about a place and then you don &apos;t find it on the map , and then he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to give our thoughts expression , where do you know that the people are better than hammer ?
the shortest has 33 different varieties of definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then this mike is a little bit of the day . mike &apos;s life lives in britain .
i &apos;ve got the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; said , &quot; said . &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to take a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i landed here .
and so , to the piece of piece , as this three days , you start to understand , why am i listening to all this kind of thing ?
they may be from a ted speaker and we can keep the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the most sophisticated , in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with such a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of
and you &apos;ve been insecure , if it was already , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of taking the most powerful , you &apos;re going to make them .
and : &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a &amp; amp ; the introvert and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human being .
we debate about the argument , &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and until now , there &apos;s only three main types of energy -- coal and gas , the way that it &apos;s almost full of -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads by turning it into electricity .
and the emissions emissions are the equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming , and it transformed to co2 .
now if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the spread of nuclear weapons is because we know that india and pakistan were working in nuclear weapons by the world &apos;s disease in the world .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most powerful is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need to support both parties -- only one or two voices are needed to be the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get out of renewables , and we &apos;re not going to get enough energy .
i used to be able to do about 10,000 years of the 10 years .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was from apollo &apos;s .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that allows us to allow the exploration of space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition in the competition , and every one of them were in the competition between one and 25 million dollars .
and we can get it to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsor is the sum of the world &apos;s energy and the social world .
would you surprise us , is that fascinated ?
that means that areas can be cut themselves . they can become incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express this new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about time because we had just seen the outside , that the surfaces kept on the bottom , in the column , that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division of division of division , michael &apos;s algorithms that create incredible , fascinating forms with millions of surfaces , not a human being , but you can build it . and you can build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- many forms here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that has been developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip is even the most prolific .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position as i am .
so i think women in our society will be leaders because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people are using the other way youtube and social networks to give their stories expression , to show their photos and tell their own stories with their own voices .
and at the same time , we &apos;re going to go to the world , and we get to explore our part of the world .
so i was more or less than &quot; nothing &quot; .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants , you pull a few apartments , you pull there . &quot;
this was called &quot; the &quot; igbo house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks , you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i put it around , and shaped the chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very reactive work , but the best things come in small pieces of time .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them when they &apos;ve done the task , they can do more extra , they can do more extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of his , this absolute , absolute , absolute , an absolute center of compassion and love that is the primary properties of the divine , and the primary properties of the divine .
my favorite body flew into a direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the front of the road that i probably didn &apos;t do with you , which i would not be able to do , which i would not be able to do , the friends i would not see , the friends i would not be able
because you don &apos;t need the most sophisticated .
and if you &apos;re going to get you from back to the wind , you can just go down and make it a lot of it in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was 15 of the chance of chance .
as i became more and more human beings -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i am now .
and nobody represents this modern health system in my eyes more than david black .
and to walk upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of international union for the international union , which is the least the most popular name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic thing to do .
so once i tried to get the piano to get me to the piano , i became strong .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the flight &quot; is not a problem , right ?
do you want me to hear ?
dp : &quot; tiger augustine . &quot;
i don &apos;t get that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is still clean , one world that &apos;s still not being fooled , in a world that &apos;s not being addressed yet .
so we know that they &apos;re able to make a performance that has been able to be able to do the research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving connection to mother , which is developed during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep the whole life for the way , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the forest in the forest now needs meat , and so the pygmies are going to be able to get the pygmies in the congo , and so many hundreds of years , they &apos;ve been living in
yesterday , somebody said that .
we &apos;re now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the new york .
do you come down and go down here ?
there &apos;s the politicians out there in politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- such a radical reduction of complexity , but yet , trying to create something more powerful .
it &apos;s actually very reactive . if you &apos;re going to form yourself , it &apos;s actually not really something .
now where they &apos;re all experts , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells , and we &apos;re playing a game .
we then see the self-assembly of this body from oil oil that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs represent this black mud -- these are the most powerful , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; is coming from the &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could be done in earth .
this is a computer company to run your tadpole on the night .
what &apos;s this -- where did they know ? they took it .
but if we did that at every fire , every fire fire could be able to redefine the emergency .
and it &apos;s the crap that &apos;s otherwise going to fix in your nice pink lungs , and it &apos;s brought into connection with -- it &apos;s going to be in connection .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can get the current news of him . you can talk to him .
but to keep this herd , a big toll of our planet will demand .
next we &apos;re going to put skin cells and multiply them in a computer factory .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years of the years of the years , and we started to do the products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to make our research on the world , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after that , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , to create mobile energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , it can also be different .
you had to survive .
and we certainly put our school school to be given to be funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from their life ?
it became a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea of a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast of the west coast .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most powerful , which was soon a big amount of brazil .
when i came to the time , my favorite , i started to start the new field of the world &apos;s field .
if you &apos;re in the south manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most productive places .
or the most powerful , the wet of the , and the wet of the places that need to be the wet of insects and the other places .
maybe a more powerful one lived there .
it &apos;s so much force in the science of science and visualization to unite these images , and it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of the level of this .
so i don &apos;t have to go closer to this .
you can do the pristine thing , of course , to stay .
this is a computer building .
one example we all know is that the mobile phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirect way .
but it happens everywhere , and these tools are parts of that , which help us create it .
seriously -- clap quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex ornish : a sustainable future looks .
you could be able to be a big problem for a law , but congress seems to be not very much to make it very much .
but if you build a lot of money , and you sell a lot of money , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found , and each single option caused the horror of this industry .
this is the simple thing .
i had a very liberal , more expensive , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought i &apos;m going to start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire current power comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you miss your country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick .
it comes into tensions , reducing the presence of the schools , and it comes between teachers and parents , so that the puppets and parents are calling the teachers and the parents , and they say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a computer system .
and our main system is creating one of the largest dynamic computers in the world for these kinds of plastic .
you see the most profound along the top of the world that we have as artists for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there are data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally and in almost every other way , so much better . &quot; i don &apos;t know a minute .
he didn &apos;t write the money , and of course ray had six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because it &apos;s in the experiment that i &apos;m going to tell you about , and i &apos;m going to prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , and we went out of the room , waiting half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were going to be two pictures and they had two beautiful pieces of light , and we said , &quot; what about it ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive , and say , &quot; you know , we give a computer company and we can make it on two different ways .
and the big car , the big car and the most powerful , are beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds of the desert , but it goes back into a time , even before we were in stories on the ground or a more aggressive , or a more aggressive thing .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of the roof of the roof , you know .
and so we went to my father , because i knew he would kill me when i was going to drive them alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy about a blue uniform , and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a
i really want to go in ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread to get me out of the way , i &apos;m going to be able to get enough metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come out again .
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret computer company .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m going to vote for the little old lady , &quot; well , &quot; i &apos;m going to be a little bit more . &quot;
she &apos;s up from the car . &quot;

we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important because this is the system that &apos;s going to come out of the life , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .

here you see the glacier coming back .
this is a couple of cameras seen .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it &apos;s become a global center for the world &apos;s center and the most powerful ?

it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; aluminum . &quot; in english , we have a lot of water .
and you have to go down .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and the way we get down is 27 percent , 600,000 percent a year , hiv will get hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles that people get out of the world &apos;s surface and bring them towards the way to the bottom and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , because they see the most powerful thing , basically every country with a computer company , say , &quot; less than 5,000 dollars , a more than 5,000 dollars , &quot; we &apos;re going to say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up right .
buy african products .
but i think a much larger problem is that this logic -- that we should drop ipods and not to drop bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas &apos;s new book .
so , 500 people have been in the way , and four of them were selected to visit the institution and so they were to get to the world , and so to be able to get to the end of it .
so now , citizens with the planning to be in planning to 2020 , not necessarily change anything , because it still is the dictators who control the agenda .
so , the internet is the internet &apos;s internet , the internet &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was standing with us younger guys .
because for me , the time in this time , and in this particular time , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you &apos;re going to do it ? &quot; either sex or drugs did we don &apos;t .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the most powerful , i &apos;m pretty much about the most powerful , which is our country , worried about india , and the talk about india as a new , very , very , very , very , very , very
with other words , all kinds of stories tell us about countries , regardless of whether they want to get to the daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country is pretty slow to be a half of the hour , and it took about half an hour to a call .
you can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes have more amazing consequences . ok .
and these from you who have your money , you may be surprised to see how many of the most powerful things are there , which is the most powerful thing to explain .
i went home and research a little bit . i found some terrifying statistics .
and the most important thing is , a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how about all the world we get to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve been able to take it for the conclusion .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of the time that &apos;s going on , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely thing that we &apos;re going to know is that the most important thing we want to do is to be very , very quickly , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see that like this .
bob mckim has a different -- another version of this exercise made in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better amount of money , much more creative results , if all of you are holding on the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all these uncertainty , as long as you go back in the corridor , as long as the doctors are in one of the most cosmopolitan to take care of a little bit of a time and you ask yourself what &apos;s going
so we would all feel sure , and we would have a good time because we agree about the rules and that would be agreed .
we do everything to succeed . but then if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re going to be satisfied , and we &apos;re going to be happy to do all that , and we &apos;re just going to hear all that ,
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a street street .
and the most hot is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he certainly hired that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to this .
and the second thing is that people are obviously experiencing a really compound .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us to determine the state of our self , our self , but it &apos;s also going to require us to form it .
it means we meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are the species that i wanted to share with you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are going to be the application of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of it
so i said , and my colleague sebastian , and i said that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to put them in the right position , and they &apos;re going to beat them with his nose and beat it .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give any kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of
a load cell measures forces and that &apos;s actually a load cell cell cell with a crystal inside .
this is the most popular -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to meet and meet the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very .
and the case is , it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical , which was ever built .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s other , not even more , not even to benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he just &apos;s going to be .
the submarine , the last year , was this one .
so , the idea of architecture is the understanding of architecture as a design , and please , excuse me to be the obvious example -- is not the right approach we have to choose .
basically , new york on the back of the world &apos;s back has been built in the back of the world &apos;s shells .
in these eight side chambers , they put small pieces of light that are basically going to be a little bit more nuanced .
so you went around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s all the second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the world , oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is torah , where actually osama bin laden is going to be a store . that &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most popular thing . let me move and show you the hubble field of space .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the beginning that the beginning of the universe is going to be .
we only have a million galaxies .
so this stuff is that the picture is in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you can &apos;t see much in it .
this simulation was taken for 1,000 processors a month , just to do this , just to make this visible .
and we hope to hope with a resolution that is about this image of the earth , which is actually the complicated pattern of the earth .
and in the consequence , we are stressed .
47 percent .
it &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re constantly doing that , even in the day-to-day life .
i got into a vicious cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost keep nothing more .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for intent to the limitations ?
this is not happening from today .
the constant is more duty , as well as a computer system , and there &apos;s a lot of the things that are going on , and it &apos;s a little bit of the behavioral degradation , and the more powerful of the environmental impact .
stalin &apos;s d &apos;s famine , the &apos; 30s , killed millions of people , killed millions of people in the &apos; 40s , and they saw the nazis , the most prolific , burning , and many of the women were born as a more popular after germany
it &apos;s the grief of the grief . &quot;
and as a psychologist , the idea of most , that we &apos;ve been talking about what we had learned in virtual world , and about our identity , could use a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way alone .
human relationships are the very compact , chaotic and more powerful .
it &apos;s going to be the same .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be able to get to be afraid , they &apos;re going to be willing to get to a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have to have any of the most successful , which had predicted some of our students , and pretty often -- -- pretty often , i felt that they had a kind of predicting in their own way .
maybe , i &apos;ve read my father at night .
so i had it in quiet -- but it had to be very friendly and very friendly .
and finally , i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to take a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time , &quot; so much .
although you lose , not fear before failure , if we &apos;ve given everything to be , because who can give a human being , when everything he &apos;s going to do .
if i call it a name , i never know a answer to it .
did i have enough to do enough ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today in many clinical trials , different types of stem cells are used for heart disease .
and only last month , it &apos;s been done with this technology that is creating the creation of human health .
we can map them and apply to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their own , and then we can just take this information and print it by print the information .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do this . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is developed , which is called the curved .
and connected to this kind of thing , there was examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the top of the president , and everything is in between -- the showed of what the power of a lot could achieve .
third , the more powerful , more powerful environmental issues .
because what you need is that this is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music that she plays .
i &apos;m hot , and i &apos;m a member of a member of kenya .
we need to get our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together , anybody has a little bit of notes ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s master , and working in a full-time job to work with this .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most powerful of the city is going to be the city of the city .
they have a lot of the tables , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes , that were given me to talk to you , between two and a people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a prison scanner in a mud mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal system , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would let this dream be true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same kind of thing i had helped me , to get to their committed support , to get a little bit more , to get a little bit more , to get a little bit more , to
and then , in fact , the only thing that was working on was , in fact , was a kind of a kind of a design , but by using a computer company , and by using a computer company , he could develop a machine that could
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to let me read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , had to be different in the different english countries , and the u.k. , united states , canada , canada , and new zealand had to have all different types of harry potter .
the main problem . lifespan has been doubled for a more than doubled and it grows with a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . do you wish people like me , okay ?
second , the new machine machine is a good news , because , once the atrocities are taking work , we don &apos;t need to do that anymore and we have to get more and more sophisticated and more sophisticated .
the social challenges because of this inequality should be a moment .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially at short view .
and my greatest concern is that we create a world with the world &apos;s technologies , embedded in a slightly more powerful society , and supported by a economy that is the inequality instead of the way that inequality supports the possibility .
in the course of the years , i started to feel more sophisticated with this notion of god .
some have a lot of the time that we can only believe in a god that divide our pain .
in the second world &apos;s second , the line of wind and waves obey him &quot; wind . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big news or a little bit of the big ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the inside , by making my own simulations .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the design of technology .
we &apos;ve been able to have a lot of the time that we &apos;ve been in the older age , and the average age of this hunters and collectors is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have used to be used to these new food .
so these equality of energy and matter , which is the einstein , and also the modern science of the world &apos;s population shows the entropy and information and matter and energy and energy and energy all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick his own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean with that is that we &apos;re looking for your new job .
a great development that started billions of years ago , moving through us and puts it on . and our choice is kind of in technology , is really in the process of the power that is much more powerful than we ourselves .
they said , &quot; well , we have five classes to get 30 to 40 students .
we took it down all the time and found beautiful , and it had beautiful , and it had the look -- while we &apos;ve been talking , you know , you know what the hull of a ship is from . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and we waited .
there are many of the things that are going on . the only problem , especially for adults who work in the academic , who didn &apos;t really know that they had a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
about 170 tutors , with them , worked on the book and this is wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s normally a little chain -- right behind it , they &apos;ve been taught like children .
there &apos;s also these kinds of things -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the middle of the world , but it &apos;s open .
he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden . he &apos;s bringing his cousin .
he writes a email , he will tell you every question you can tell you .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace means the end of the clash , and there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one , which is the manual for complete idiots , you knew that ?
on cape , there &apos;s a streets of roads , and we can go to the ground .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad .
so i came from complications .
i found that cheetos are very good .
the university is most difficult , so number 10 .
from everything in a strange , strange , the way that it &apos;s a window , it &apos;s a little bit of a window to the moment that the street was black , and that white , the street was black in the sun .
and i was reminded of the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with faith , but to do with behavior .
the most sophisticated , geographically , the same size , it &apos;s not like that , but it &apos;s just the same size as the united states , and it &apos;s just the same size of the united states , which is about the same size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait to be waiting for the most powerful , which was australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the world &apos;s brain that we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures to the preview , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the design of design and design .
rca is really a extraordinary school in this sense .
we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as stupid as stupid .
here &apos;s examples of that , you can print a hint of the way that it &apos;s very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit of a fool .
we did the same for iraq .
this was a challenge we had to ask as physicists .
we can push it up . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re more nuanced .
&quot; naturally seven &quot; a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and we have a sense of what &apos;s right in life , which is just in life , which is just in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , he &apos;s a while , he &apos;s a lot of the time .
so every week , the most popular thing would come to come out . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me answers again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- call it the way that it was .
we treat them with the drugs -- the -- the , frankly , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get so slow to a sense of how much rock we talk about here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows at all . these are only stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- which is a part of a comet in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a computer company and we can choose to change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the most powerful thing , and a great company would be , if the mystic was just gone , what was going on as right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;ll never see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re going to make your business business , which is what you actually did .
look , we started in east europe and we started to work with russia .
after a while , we opened a computer company .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , sharing bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you &apos;re organized the funding that it doesn &apos;t have any more , no blind , no blind , to find yourself .
so why does it work like this ? this is the question .
well , some of the people call this a theory of everything .
just example , this is : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided through the square of the computer &apos;s square objects between each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you put the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing that he thought about is most of us today , but to his time , it wasn &apos;t of course .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of this fan that they follow the laws of law , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had books .
from this ambition , he was driven in the back of the back .
but when he was just in the way , his signature under the most popular , his hand was deaf , and he was crying because he had a thousand hands during a computer company .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was , with this aging lion of a man that &apos;s so many hours .
and so as lincoln told the story , all of the war went to britain .
i asked my father under tears : &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love is to be the story that allows me to spend a life in the past .
he had the temple , and he had the temple .
this is the most popular thing that is the evidence that the jews after exile in babylon , after all the years they were sitting in babylon , were crying in babylon , and the memory of jerusalem was going to go home .
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the cylinder cylinder is from the priests of the great , the great of the great world &apos;s heritage , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of thousands of people came to tehran , and they came to tehran .
some knowledge more about the living lives , but they think they &apos;re a kind of a nasty bad thing .
the new ones were crying in the first few hours , but their needs were not going to be able to be able to get to make it , and they were not going to be able to make them , and they were not going to be able
a study shows that support support 10 percent of a brain costs cost about 30 percent of the world &apos;s cost .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to find a answer .
it was a school student , and most of them -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course , he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , the hobby , really one of my heroes and mentors , did it , and it &apos;s done , unicef to the boat .
so he said , &quot; well , we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed the peace and their possibilities , etc . , etc . , and they were really going to be .
we connect with the design of the -- i met a lot of the time , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s about inflation .
it &apos;s about their own business , to their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively more vulnerable .
i went to the literature of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big primate story .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors have invented before 1.5 million years ago when they discovered cooking .
right , very simple approaches for the most powerful conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fight is the fight , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to .
behind him , a child was a kid , his son , red in the face of effort , to push his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
at night , i spoke to my bosses in the headquarters , and i told them -- i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a few hours a day , just for some of the time . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s most powerful started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we have to increase production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and it &apos;s not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer company .
and this hospital could have been able to afford to do this .
why ? because the way i took it was banned .
but i learned something more powerful than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy of ghana -- very bad decisions that had been brought to our economy .
because i knew that the state of the african continent was important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in a hoodie .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society in a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very similar to the most yellow ball , the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , is not familiar with it .
32 pills of the &quot; the &quot;
it &apos;s probably a lot of time . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages you communicate ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsor love it , and it &apos;s going to bring it all over the television .
a professional computer system , who talks to dead , doesn &apos;t get me ?
what is the blink ?
we &apos;d like to have suggestions from you , how to put them out , and we &apos;d put it in the community , and they were doing something that they do .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often going on a generator .
it has to give a better thing . &quot;
but this is what the user can control whether there &apos;s electricity or not , because you can control the most powerful on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and the most effective device that we can provide hospitals to provide .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was the first thing that was the script , which is the script of a secret society in the world &apos;s office .
anyway , when a computer company called john dissonance , he discovered in the most violent , in the world &apos;s office in the world &apos;s office , who were in 1800 to 1900 b.c. , centuries of the year of the year of the centuries of centuries .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the finance to make the other things and animals on the line of the line , is not just so good .
and it was a french issue .
a picture of fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be that maybe it would not be so bad .
and i asked myself a question about a year , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no a vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekend is the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all names , although it &apos;s sometimes going to make mistakes .
they &apos;re distracted . he finally wins the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be my , it &apos;s about interested in finding more about it when the ones are so high , but it &apos;s a very reactive area .
or a aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in the mind of the way -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated , but maybe not very .
jh : is it a mess to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s a lot of the time , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be a little bit of the time .
this is a great retreat in the studio .
we take the pizza , our very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
i was sure , before i first went into art art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to choose the work .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating alternatives , and they needed money for it , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was a two-year-old -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most important thing you say is , everything you say is because of the most important fear of the health .
he &apos;s a computer company of the aboriginal aboriginal , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it depends with origami . so go .
people were used to understand mathematical principles on the art of the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re moving it on the top and they make 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules with these things that you put circles , and you covered the light with lines , which is the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need a little origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work if you &apos;re in space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a computer factory in the state of washington with too much more .
we just have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about this .
and so i want to talk about this because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before women start to be able to get the market market , and it goes on to the
you gave instructions from top .
because i write about all this a book , i still have to do it , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
there &apos;s no way that we have this information , and you get back to us in the form of culture , in this strange and more sophisticated way where you can see that the consumerism is changing .
there &apos;s no man or a woman who stands in the middle and it &apos;s the wires to the too lazy .
and the personal income on a scale that was kept constant to consider inflation , in this time more than doubled , almost tripled .
and to hear me , and to understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still happening , so in the last book of me , &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo that are very successful from her environment as a very successful and very ethical , very social sense of sense .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your , but not very much .

because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning , what home is , they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was made of birth to them . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or the present , as in the past .
i went down into the room where i should sleep .
so , the most powerful thing is , where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .

the kids are the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you &apos;re the british and your mortality rate in heart disease . &quot;
but if you &apos;re people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the computer , and then they were growing , and then i worked with a lot of time -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old they are .
you could be in summer as well at the equator .
so , a lot of progress , many of the things .
this is actually real photography , in time , which shows that the limb is going to be in less days .
and here you see what six months later is happening , which is technically appropriate .
a blood vessel is made from two different types of cell cell .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance , the most complex solid organs are the high amount of organs , with every amount of dna organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the most violent .
we prefer cells that are not going to be lit and not make tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there would have any idea out there .
so i &apos;m just a little bit in panic -- unlike all the of the absence and sugar i had -- but this is really really really scary for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a computer company .
i went from door to door and sold plate plate .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .

these young , the waiter .
the development of the students today is to throw all the interests of a board .
the most important thing about the most powerful or a computer &apos;s disease is taking the most of our students .
the values of the past will also be also also a lot of society . that brings a lot of society .
but it &apos;s an politics of principles , not the most powerful .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be concerned about when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what it is about , you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , it &apos;s not a rights organization , but it &apos;s clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to get their content to the freedoms that they want to leave them .
john behar .
and i wonder how often happens .
he told me that he was the most popular and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;ll now be there . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i run it through this process and show you how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric was also happy .
i survived , just with that , we &apos;re really going to understand .
i &apos;m always asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of being spread in microbes is through people . architects are like to put spaces in the same way , and architects like to promote the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in a book .
imagine a design that &apos;s taking microbes , for example , in the plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the company , built a system called the performance of the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most violent .

this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the most powerful .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to be able to be able to do the most important thing to do today , which is what science is going to be really going to do .
there are the color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to go to the constant change of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a two-year-old , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a single one on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- enjoy a very special value than the representative , the embodiment and the main of the chinese civilization , the most powerful .
he was in the morning , in the morning , in the morning , in the morning , in the morning , and shanghai .

i made graffiti , writing my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .

&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a little bit of a face of a face -- that &apos;s a face , right here ? &quot;
most places i went to go to , i decided to go to the media , because i had heard about them in the media .
i took more photos and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were beaten , a woman , &quot; now , god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each picture .
but they &apos;ve basically been a promise of me in the case .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and what they &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a more powerful .
they &apos;ve been able to have a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participation . cities have been welcome to participation , and they &apos;ve been welcome to participation .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very , very much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
this would produce a major amount of energy .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , ideas , ideas that we think about , are going to be a particularly brilliant century , and it &apos;s not a very brilliant century , and not one of the most powerful century , and not one of the most powerful
my left family is boring academics who are concerned with the way that we &apos;re doing it , to collect the most powerful of the world &apos;s brain .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something was really left .
i sat , like you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career has been brought up , and i &apos;ve got a lot of success .

so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is honored to be here at ted 2006 between all of the einstein &apos;s today , in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall down .

sw : big final .
sw : what about a computer company ?
my parents found this very important for their inner quiet .

there are the cavalry , men on horses and with the most cosmopolitan .
goliath is easy prey . he doesn &apos;t have any chance .
so goliath is a lot larger than the time of the time , and usually there &apos;s a explanation for that when someone is so far outside the norm .
and i think that there &apos;s a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a computer , and these microbes are mostly good , rather than killing us .
they all have the microbes , and then they used the little bit of the the receiver .
most pills , or the most powerful , you can eat , you have a or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a design system for the microbes that live in and live in people so that we can understand what they &apos;re doing .
very many people think about the internet , and it &apos;s very fixed to the internet , but for us , it &apos;s really global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .

so dolphins can be able to be able to be able to be in the distance .

but we found fast that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat at a keyboard .
this dolphin , we called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; because it &apos;s about 12 of the years of the years of the years .

she went down and kept on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the right , the right , the liberal god -- and both work together .

there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these kinds of photos of stars that are all the time -- you call them a little bit of the time .
it doesn &apos;t look about a way of a way , but you have to imagine your world mentally .
stairs , which is from a plastic winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the illusion that if you buy these lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without wires .

the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of all the mass .
and now , you pay the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a model of what &apos;s going on during the most prolific .
they move away from each other because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like galaxies -- their own , as many of them are , as a function of time -- can we bring in experience , which is dark matter and dark energy in the competition to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
so , the sleepy man , the final man , is , &quot; new jersey ? &quot;
so , recycling and unconscious are here .
marc : 1.3 million reasons to invent the most powerful
and in fact , this change in gay men were in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and many children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence of the spread .
that &apos;s a pretty similar thing to close .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about diseases . that should not be surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s prison .
emily &apos;s once studied the aids statistics in africa , and it comes to an surprising consequence : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i fascinated it because i watched this kind of kind of kind of kind of an of the italian italian .
he was called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; because he was the front of the time , but every time he was in a tunnel , he built a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
these bumps are going to work on the water like a magnet .
then we ask ourselves why the membrane is activated and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the world &apos;s office , in a material .
in the world , my favorite , i &apos;m working with the most powerful , and i &apos;m working with the most powerful architects .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , not a young boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen again , because it &apos;s now , and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a very high for 1,000 inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most powerful movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did for a few years later , a kind of development of captcha .
and basically , you &apos;re going to start with a old book .
the number of pages that are actually using the metabolic is that the number of words we digitize a day is very , very large .
some are more funny .
and at the time , the web is divided in several languages .
then my favorite question comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a stick .
but what perhaps more surprising is the translations we get from the most sophisticated , even if you &apos;re just a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that we &apos;re going to get , as the professional , the translations we &apos;re getting , and that
there are people as they &apos;re learning to be worth , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay with their time .
the process of the site , the company , makes it what you really can do .
and the active participation is all other than normal .
and zipcar offers a very attractive , more powerful service , the fabulous works .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal of all other things .
maybe these people have right . his thoughts is not good .
10 percent of the time , the thought of the mind -- ... sex .
i played the violent african african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , no more explicit , no more explicit , it had no one of the most absolute majority -- so the elections in a second round of three weeks later .
here &apos;s a more interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we were that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re breathing from a certain reason and so forth .
and so charles , i &apos;m going to give money to make a building , give you a building , and you can meet you there , but please don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought that every one of the things that would do was do this .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i &apos;ve got something that &apos;s not personally personally .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneurs will be entrepreneurs .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up -- it &apos;s not going to go up . we &apos;re measuring it for 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to be very carefully .
jaclyn kary mullis talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own favorite , and the curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their forms .
i wanted to represent a very simple body , which is occupied with these kinds of things that are occupied with these things .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; naked city &quot; and the most powerful , the most powerful and the feeling of the feeling of the world &apos;s feeling in a urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin is one of my favorite favorites .
and the whole time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat on some of these places , until recently , when i was in london , the naked channels was in the way .
the first question is , and maybe they write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual sheet in their head , and , for the audience , they can try to do that .
and then we &apos;re breaking up , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific school of the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , you know -- you &apos;re going to be in the meantime , you &apos;ve thought , &quot; hmmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is when people have a notion of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between organic , living world and the inorganic world .
and you can see , he &apos;s going to be able to get out of it , growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter to a colleague that was probably going to be able to be able to do that somewhere in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe somewhere else , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands of really big molecules , in the same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create the inorganic biology , and matter of it , it will be developed , then that &apos;s actually going to define life .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development development : every single one is going to measure .
and these are high professional students sitting in a woman who sit in an hour with a woman and ask them to ask them .
i was really sitting at friday , and i could see how the mortality rate of the day of the day was on 84 to 84 .
how you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of measuring a average of improvement that &apos;s not and this very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality and families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
whatever remains is worth money .
yes , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; the most important thing in question .
all the time was a border of the world .
and the way i think , the world is going to get forward , and it will make a difference , not just for some , but for every one .
... above the knee , yes , that would be difficult ...
the most popular -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody greed .
and babies die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific industry research -- 40 labs -- if two of the people were not talking to each other , i built teams .
they &apos;re on the same , and now i have apps in the app app .
it &apos;s about a little bit old and a little old to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more consistent .
but this reactor doesn &apos;t have a high pressure , and it &apos;s not so reactive , which is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is a innovative energy source that &apos;s going to provide great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move to a force of a experience where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the most powerful that is going to be able to get it in the forest .
at the end of a long , good advice he &apos;s going to be able to do his son , he says , &quot; especially , &quot; especially , is the most important thing to you .
you don &apos;t normally go in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot of time out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be wrong as a wrong , as a result of the way that they &apos;re doing , by making properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introverted and stayed for me alone .
then it was just about starting to start and build it until the end of the day .
so i made it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the nation-state is being developed 32 days : poor and hands are going to be 36 days : the primitive spine starts to train these weeks in the fastest .
the complexity , this is in a single system , again , in a single system , or every of the existing math .
because apparently there &apos;s no one that &apos;s not going to be the atmosphere of sun-like stars in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
recently , a colleague sent me from berkeley , a email , a email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the world &apos;s surface , and the other thing that &apos;s made of the animal and chemical elements in the universe , and they &apos;re being made in the universe and they &apos;re going to be able to get into the universe .
because can you imagine that everything is going to be ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just standing on and say , &quot; so , let &apos;s give it . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the world &apos;s disease , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m easy to get out of a little bit of a bit of a talk , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- that &apos;s actually what it looked like .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no a more powerful , no one . &quot;
what are you going to feel vulnerable to ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t have right . stop .
we do that as if that was what we do , no impact on other people .
people are going to be their meals in twitter , the declaration of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re going to make systematic improvements , and then we think about how they can be useful to our most useful , for our main and understandable .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , and we wanted to find a new access to health care .
steven is so sharing his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing that was the only thing that was the only thing that was online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a lot of a data , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not going to go to scientific methods .
this is the curve over the world &apos;s surface .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to him .
if we went from here to the most of the time , we would go to something that 300 meters high , 120 miles long , 28 miles wide , and the two of the terabytes weighs .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a computer &apos;s disease .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called so-called &quot; the so-called &quot;
and the way is networks are ideals of more complex systems .
and it also has implications on the climate system .
so we could put a little bit of a set of a set of a set of a set .
we see the emergence of the world &apos;s creation and the programs that are focused on understanding our connected world from the complexity of complexity .
and the more powerful capacity to have a capacity to have a capacity of the capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these kinds of things .
without human health .
so we were up on our own .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is a kind of a representation of negative , to positive in the world .
because this question is ahead that our external world can predict our own predictions , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the world &apos;s most important thing when i &apos;m going to get your entire external world .
and that &apos;s a scientific science of scientific , and it &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re moving people to be open up , a positive email of the most powerful , and to write a positive email of someone in their social environment .
and so hard to say -- a computer , you understand -- my father was the most popular man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit .
they said , they &apos;re going to stop .
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is four o &apos;clock in the morning .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i &apos;m doing , the world to taste .
and i was going to be talking about passion .
their culture is not coming in schools , and i want to illustrate them , how we can overcome this problem .
it &apos;s so nervous , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools , where there are no young ones .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who have raised boys ?
we need to change the posture of young people in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to happen .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that we can give that &quot; why &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i &apos;m going to try that , at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act on a object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s filled with radio with my ipad , and this is a software that goes on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer company . so i added them to a computer company , so that people respond to the glass of the glass , if you &apos;re on the ground .
i &apos;m going to turn in a man in a middle of the middle ages , and then in a old man .
and 36 extra , allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
fold the wings together , and they go on .
so i &apos;m going to give you another question .
and he had a royal , and he had a royal , which had instructions , and night , and night , and the secret instruction , it didn &apos;t really make it good to the most powerful .
because they found that the human behavior is more likely to be stronger .
yet , we have to create a clear thing to do , which is what you can create , which is a value of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we &apos;ve all been available to these tools , we just need to ask the question -- and thaler and the most powerful , and we &apos;ve done this -- how we use these smart .
they lead the new design system .
they give small , more cosmopolitan , more cosmopolitan .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; without . &quot;
all around us , it &apos;s going to be a different replicator in this particular institution of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than a space for them .
we &apos;re the only most sophisticated and more sophisticated .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet to produce more and more and more amazing things that we hear at ted .
and will we go through this third danger , how we &apos;ve been growing the second and first of the first ?
in collaboration with a lot of time -- that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with different kinds of plastic , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn to 70 percent of my body , the whole one was about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good to get me down to the pain of the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most important people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated , had been the less religious -- those who were not able to remember the night -- more and more , they had no commandments .
so if you don &apos;t think of a few seconds , because you get a brand , you make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces have very bad implications on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most popular ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes brand brand , and it &apos;s defined with the bottom of the line , defined how they want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems to be too big ?
i &apos;m not going to explain it to the audience , and i had to explain it -- last week i had to explain my roommate -- skeletons are structures that transport sperm from a individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most popular here , or even most animals are not tracking their tissues by contract them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton we found to the nature of nature , we had found the same kind of thing .
all that i showed that was really surprised about it .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i have to be now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the main thing , and the benefits , and the benefits of a great education , are the benefits of a great education .
the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing about it , and ben became a computer company .
and is it going to go to what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of the time .
but remarkable , the u.s. &apos;s most amazing of the united nations has estimated the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to stand very cheaply to be available .
but could not be done for this angle of the labor market ?
they asked the governments to support the governments , and they have a lot of cases , they get them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the goal of bringing new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the &apos; 40s , as sir , and the british society , the british society was thought that this is the sun .
so , what &apos;s fusion ? here &apos;s something called a little bit more .
and this energy is the fusion that is burning .
so , about the conventional power power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a great impact .
they wanted to do most of the democracy , but they were all the countries who were in the world &apos;s population , the most prolific in the last month , they had been raised by a passenger , and they were only four percent .
but the expectations of people were getting significant to their future .
so the question is , &quot; what does the male support for women &apos;s women are going to be ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s reading the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send a text .
you could see the immediate impact of laws or the one of the most powerful speech on a computer , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 ft .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a computer company .
from the smallest of the world &apos;s most responsible forces of nature .
we can afford to do the individuals in the way that we &apos;re going to get to the individuals .
we believe that somebody else , someone else , someone &apos;s more , someone &apos;s more tools , will solve somebody with more tools .
we didn &apos;t flew him into the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s a page that &apos;s going to be the incredible metabolic , which is possible , and this enormous serious thing that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral .
and the director was quite a very subtle and said that he was holding me for crazy . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a facility facility . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several such events to do that , until i found what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer plan of the computer plan .
and you look down , and you &apos;re looking down , and it &apos;s tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage 15 years ago , and i had to give up the courage to go back to the life of the world , and in my country , where i can do this incredible rides with this group of ethiopia
and how often would my self have to die before i was going to understand that it &apos;s not going to exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
strangely , the insights that don &apos;t mean my low self-esteem , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have anything in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have when we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and the very happy thing is that next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at that , we focused on the way that we work .
we also discovered that as a design structure and a kind of a way of getting through this structure , it would be a way of going to be .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project is actually going to find -- but that seeds -- in the leading of the world , they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the seeds .
we worked with a computer company to develop a computer designer , so that even if you &apos;re visually impaired , so it &apos;s kind of a kind of a little bit more powerful and soft , that &apos;s a piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few gun you &apos;re aware of , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all his structure of his socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like people to do good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether these generalizations are being avoided , but then the most important thing that we did is to support this .
another one of the humanities and the most important of the universities , which are actually in the decline of the decline .
well , the other hot iron iron is parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better .
i also call a little bit of a time of the time , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you don &apos;t confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these kinds of things .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
your iphone without people who do the same skin , the same circuits , the same keyboard , always and again .
and then it became more powerful and more powerful and more powerful and so forth .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so , is it true that you have a fake here ? &quot;
but how do you sit on a mentally normal way ?
so all of these things were all the things that were going on on tony , evidence for the other , and he &apos;s going to be crazy to this new kind of crazy .
he came in in a professional business and the 30 percent of the workforce , and he turned to the u.s. cities just in the world .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the very widespread aspects of the personality .
and as it was , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m going to represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west was needed to be necessary in the framework of communism .
and even though the president , the president , it &apos;s very , very good , has been hit with the power of islam , not the enemy , there &apos;s nonetheless , a natural impulse in the other side of the other side than a enemy .
when the treasure was in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best , the scientists who had ever been the scientists for african penguins -- that at that point as endangered species .
the day after our arrived , two of us were going to be in the world &apos;s head of the room 2 , and space two , and the two had more than 4,000 with oil .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue again .
and that &apos;s really important because african penguin was explained to a endangered way of being a endangered way .
at the ted row , the ted row , at the most popular , in front of a computer , in the world &apos;s office , and even before the police station .
people are open for the most powerful .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second class of the second grade .
these teach the lessons came up , abstract .
hillel asked himself a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s going on to you is not the neighbor , that &apos;s the rest of your neighbors . that &apos;s the rest of the rest .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body body and the hands of the child , and the two men see each other , and they see each other , and they see each other as divine .
this is what the cells have really been looking at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s beginning .
we all see the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are from 700 mm thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s a x-ray .
it has human association .
in the x-ray , we see all the little bits of light in the corners .
i had to have the car in the middle of the middle , and i &apos;ve had no simple task .
yes , they &apos;ve given 12 monkeys to a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not agree .
not professor and a half , only two spirits , ready to be ready .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacturing was that it was really responsible between the most powerful between the most powerful and the most powerful .
would you even be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with a billion dollars , and you &apos;re listening to a billion dollars , to study a billion of the people that he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but then more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these shell shell had fast their own , and the most important in london was very , very important in london .
this is too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re all going to leave them . people leave us .
there are places that you can &apos;t do , the idea you can &apos;t think of worlds that you can &apos;t vary anymore .
they have a computer and a freedom of that i believe that it &apos;s the foundation of a new computer system .
she has hit the decision , not to get a more powerful or a more powerful , but your life is dedicated to that that this is not happening .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to get me to this thing , and then it happens .
but it doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find it , but he didn &apos;t think he was going to be in the recovery , and they said , &quot; you go to the recovery , or you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull them out .

we can only ask : &quot; how hot the most powerful of the world &apos;s brain ? &quot; and you know , right ?
it &apos;s replaced the workers through technology .
you can see the left in the screen , a few symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even if we become much older , our cars are going to go to the way we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .
it was always more obvious that we cannot win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me bring the result to the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the librarians are the same as jewish maternal replacement .
i think there are some reasons , actually , many reasons , but here &apos;s just some of us to focus on .
he was attracted by the flames , he was shaking her , he was like a computer company to the light , a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
let me go from door to the international community , and see if somebody &apos;s police , or troops for these practices .
but sergio was too late .
he saw her .
the power power about a complicated hero about a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities all over the entire world .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about food , because actually , this year , last year , and 2008 during the most important , and 2008 , in the world &apos;s brain , it &apos;s been available for every single pound .
and i go into these stores when they &apos;re there , and they &apos;re out in the fields to see what they can get , and i find it , they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in school school .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a more powerful .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a kind of a device , not because it shows me how many of the things i do every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , what i do .
that never was shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see this technology a single neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution up enough , you can actually all be able to get all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute is about the most prolific person .
for example , if i &apos;m here -- longer than a few seconds , they would be uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the room in the camps .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that is at the most common time in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends , richard , and kevin &apos;s , and kevin &apos;s .
while we cross miles and miles from the air , frozen , the most frozen , the most violent .
so , like i &apos;m here today , i &apos;m talking about the most about five years , i went to the most five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the wild feet .
the ocean is going to determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
and there are easy .
this is the result when you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we can take the ocean .
in the past three years , the u.s. is good for example , for example , the u.s. sea of sea .
we need a total , new technologies to exploration the ocean .
a lot of my early career wanted to figure out how the wings of insects generate enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual health &apos;s mouse from jeff &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a little bit of a design of a lot of behavior to be able to do a different kind of behavior , another kind of a different , and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a computer model and the more realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look closer to the neocortex of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to be able to get out of it , and it &apos;s a little bit of the other components , and it &apos;s a computer , like in a computer .
how many a type of a tree is there ? where are they in the place ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it turns out , and watch what happens .
and the main thing is that the secrets of the brain can be solved soon . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and it &apos;s going to plan to find them with a supercomputer that &apos;s going to be
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a computer company that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think that it has something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , those who give a lot of the way , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it &apos;s going to get back to the other complex .
a online of a online , a hundred dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is , the way we really don &apos;t know our biases .
in medical , it &apos;s our view of the view of this .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- you can only use the eyes of the eyes with low energy .
their intensity can be very fast , and they can get very quickly off .
they &apos;re critical .
but the only one .
cars have a lot of the cars and they can communicate and communicate with the car lights with the cars and communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s all life about .
it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome , and the power of it is a kind of a temporary medicine that is better than today -- it has no side side .
he &apos;s really simple -- just to be an informed gene -- but we could completely be able to be completely embarrassed .
we don &apos;t walk as small organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in the moment in the moment that we have a page of people who think you &apos;re going to raise a dog , first of all , by making rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , we do &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to get it for six to 10 .
these are like golden &apos;s .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be it .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about working with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard to make them sound .
and even less rare , if it &apos;s accompanied by the most powerful and more , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert expand a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus made the same tool over 30 generations of the same .
you can teach you to practice a little bit more problematic , and there &apos;s also a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a different animals , but the exchange of a object is never happening .
it &apos;s the wealth ; the pleasure of your needs is to save time .
we &apos;ve reached this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to do objects like this , the way that they were a little bit more , that a exchange of groups existed in the way that a exchange was in between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are taking , and that &apos;s never because of the ideas that are going to be able to go to the other , and to get to the face of the ideas , and i &apos;m also sure that
this is so high as a building building , and i &apos;ve been putting the leader as compared to the .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
these are just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most sophisticated detection detection , then normally the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that change all the time ?
i talked about this -- you know , you know , that situation , if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis of the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we did a part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new , far more , very much more .
after 10 other days , they came back -- still a fever -- they still got a lot of oxygen -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic misunderstanding , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could have this .
we &apos;re instead of doing something that fits to the most important of the world &apos;s brain .
i brought a little more dense with a low density on the top , a high density of dense density , and salt salt in between .
but david is young and smart and he wants to make a computer company , and so he &apos;s building the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the most violent , six miles before the coast of the coast of the coast of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface .
fast , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to be interested in maria , and their methods and how they found this kind of thing and how important they found it , they &apos;re going to discover things and they won &apos;t be taught to be a open way of being able to do it
evolution is often considered one way that we chose , but it actually represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space space .
our cities are endangered , because many of you are on the coast .
there are stars and so .
so if we think about the brain system or body language , how it &apos;s called the social scientists , it turns around language . so we think about communication .
this expression , as proud of jessica tracy was studied by jessica tracy , and she showed that the people and birth of the blind people , they do , if they win in a computer company .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re going to be on these people and see how they participate . could you get them to do it , and would you get more involved in it ?
what happens in a computer company , what happens when you &apos;re going on on the ground stage ? how the following little manipulation of this tiny little bit of the little little bit of the little little bit of the little little bit ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for only a few minutes , where you can actually apply this ? that &apos;s of course .
these things . people are kind of showing me the true thing , and they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look for it . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other way in the big scale .
and the swim of swimming , to get to your own , and you get a ant , and you get a ant , and you get a blade of a blade of a blade , and you go up to the brain , and you go up a
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a design of a way , you have to have a response .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i think that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re basically extinct .
but under all these ideas that are going to be able to spread our technology in the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as we should not try and get here , we &apos;re not trying to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the one .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody agrees the other .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of a vibrant computer .
i don &apos;t want to get out that it should have happened , but that we need to be better when it &apos;s about answering questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save a life .
it deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s explained that they don &apos;t have married children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and a kind of old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll keep the best speech you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the big majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and his fundamental value was respect to strangers .
who fighting , while he goes ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more , more and more , and since recently , she has a income to support her family .
just go to somebody , with another culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and they &apos;re involved in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start where the story started , 1985 in the field of time .
now , before you &apos;re going to get the way you get the way to get the way to a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these less famous houses , which are 50,000 indigenous people living , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we repair are consequences of the world &apos;s consequences , things that were actually doing around .
we did this . he got a lot of the time .
we found out later that in this region failure , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing is , in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , nelson mandela didn &apos;t say far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not intuitive . it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work
i don &apos;t realize it if you call me a little bit of a time . not .
it really sounds a lot of water that &apos;s going on from here to say , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
and i &apos;m going to go to this statement , and i think that kids should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest government of the world &apos;s population in america with our own health system .
this is a picture of the mayor of the bronx who was going to be born in his house , not in prison , so they felt the more powerful .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small pieces of wood , they &apos;re the great thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create responsibility under the most amazing , which is incredibly .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold kids from these stores away .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s going to get the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see the difference here as an underdog , here is a increase of the brain &apos;s surface right after this sharp line .
to 10 : the pig suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine , which is an aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine migraine , and we need a design system . i think we &apos;re now .
my first wish is that the most popular thing for epilepsy , the most powerful , for the most powerful , for the treatment of the world -- is used for the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take cases on the hope of the hope on the goods on the fats of the world , which is the poor patients of compassion , who are the poor patients of compassion .
a year ago , four of the five of the most popular of the most popular , in ushahidi , is called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , also , &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
where do you know what &apos;s really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got it the first time to get it here .
and these people below the barrier , i call a little bit of the way , because they &apos;re really going to be absorbed from the process , to share their knowledge .
they have to use , in the way , to use the platform to develop their materials and to develop their materials , and they teach them about the world to teach teachers to teach teachers .
yes , books that may be sold 100 or 1,000 spending in the year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise everybody , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the world &apos;s day are over , if people say , &quot; well we &apos;d like to have three or more of them in our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a more powerful . it &apos;s a education project .
you can use some thousand children with two of them .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a 100 dollars a laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things and stare around screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing , &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line , and we can &apos;t keep out of information .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , they also get their child to clean .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , to prevent the most powerful .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , as simple as the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , you take the childhood , which shows this graph . it &apos;s the early youth in the early youth .
the idea that your father in the public was singing , she was going to be able to get it out .
this is the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the cdc , in austria , to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to put it up there , and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a while online , 24 hours a day
but in the night , while we were doing the most powerful , i asked the legendary , how the most powerful , they would have a sam , they would kiss sam .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place that my family has been working on four generations in the world &apos;s office .
so , i have no idea what it has with a adoption of the adoption , but they &apos;re incredibly reactive .
the first thing you see in the most powerful is the terrible force of the design .
he &apos;s just screaming on my leg , picks me up , bring me up to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct business is the world .
it just , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect , as technology .
it &apos;s the most popular of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in all kinds of things .
you should know that in every community , the number of the world &apos;s number is already increasing .
i led three main projects in antarctica .
but i say , where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important kind of light for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re in the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing fishing . &quot;
of course , the most open and open seas , but the open seas , the everybody likes to look at it , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge plastic and huge amounts of energy .
now there &apos;s a lot of the immediate , immediate , automated , automated , more available about many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no single answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he was very carefully documented what happens again when technology is the first time in a environment and in a community .
so there is , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves &apos;s painting .
i mean , that was at least how it was happy to me .
now , there was a question that i was going to do in a head of a minute , and i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of whom i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here &apos;s the front of the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the way to go out .
they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered as a very talented in the field of time , because i knew the most powerful , and i know how to use the world &apos;s favorite , and i can work quickly with the most powerful .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends who are in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s .
as christian , and made out of the world &apos;s and made out of the world &apos;s office , young jewish men in the united states , and canada , and superman , who also go back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim world &apos;s last muslim world .
the biggest evil , the most important , don &apos;t want that rocks to be able to get the stone . so he tries to stop it at the most important time .
and one of my favorites is a very , very , very , very , very , very .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
and it &apos;s got to be a little bit of a time that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group of yourself is identified as extremely .
and the most important thing is , islam &apos;s being diagnosed by islam .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight you for them .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to engage with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the most popular is named the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or a more powerful ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after some months of search , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that &apos;s called a kind of molecule that &apos;s called a little bit of the same vibration .
this is the basis of the device that &apos;s built these two people from ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
and at the time , a series of things are going on in the process that i want to pay attention to you .
and she actually didn &apos;t have a notion of the context that she landed in .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody , neither my mother , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my brother , my aunts , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i &apos;m going to share . i just share that i had two things when i left the orphanage , which i wanted to do . that was one , my family , and the other , poems to write .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us are running up there and find small parts .
he had a computer company and so , and it has to be more accurate from other people , female and probably a lot smaller family members to reach his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to that we will be the progressive species that exists on the planet on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to the course of the world ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a store , and i wanted to buy a computer designer -- we had a computer plan .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my suggestion : about 70 layers of this , the most of the time , is going to take a lot of the time .
you want to know how obsessed with me , i &apos;m really ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to buy a chinese newspaper from the san francisco to buy the bird with a reasonable slide ...
when we &apos;re going to get the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect , a perfect , the smell of the smell and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever walk again , just with a computer company . &quot;
i remember my father was going out to me out of the wheelchair , and i was on the top of the top , and i felt the sun on my face , and i felt the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was going to give me the phone phone and i called the flight flight , i was going to say , i &apos;d like to get a computer company .
and i said , &quot; &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m in the way .
it &apos;s like a computer company , which flies through a richard serra .
how about hell , i &apos;m going to make a phone in three weeks when i have these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of these elements could hang on the wall as a kind of artistic object .
in his days , he was the highest of the highest .
i look at individual , and how they flow -- how they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most powerful . it &apos;s made of aluminum , and it &apos;s grown out of aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water stamp .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels completely , of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and after i did my dr. , i had the lucky , a member of a computer , who used him to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most popular .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer company to be a more powerful to be blind to animals , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to find food and partners .
i urge you to call a different science that &apos;s used still hundreds of years old .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself to rediscover the value of sleep .
and at june at june , i heard a loud bang at the disk , which changed my life and finished the duck .
and here &apos;s the duck .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the impact of the impact of birds on the life of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to get it to the food , i can hear music and write .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream of martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you can see more often that former legal is now the most powerful .
you don &apos;t want to say anything to be used to do that , which could be used against a life . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers want to make order ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so , that freedom has a structure of structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and the biggest change : we need to have the authority for the interpretation and application of law , and the officer .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be completely a little bit of a sudden .
and the limits of interest , the most powerful , can calculate the most powerful and for the power that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to be very difficult to be a ruler with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he was only a more successful one .
but the problem , to leave on rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to make the professional activity , and they &apos;re making the professional activity in two ways .
so smart , so much , is better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise , a lot of smart things can get this to be upright .
why did this idea spread ?
people want to be a lot of time .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to take a little bit more closely to light , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was a turtle , the turtle .
we have to do this with a full of a full of the whole .
what i want to show you is what you needed to transport 34 pounds up to the high uranium .
what if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck to the truck that you just saw somewhere in the back of the world .
part of the problem is that the most powerful self , are overwhelmed by the thoughts of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me from someone who &apos;s a computer company who &apos;s a computer company , and the fact is that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there that are done the wrong things and the problems still have .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them out ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working working , a dangerous working environment .
imagine we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
governments who do most of the progress are governments that have found ways , &quot; shared value in business , rather than seeing the government that &apos;s going to say the unique thing .
maybe i can cut this up , and i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on a moment with me in the 19th century , just to the 24 of june .
we might certainly be productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look down to the british government to get money for the building of babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines would have enormous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just allow less wealthy men to the research , but they also were upset with the most prolific , rather than answering the question of the question .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person wrote a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the old enough , they have no idea how these infection happened -- which is through these jets .
there are about 10,000 programs in the process .
this would be the frequency in the one that you can find every one of the 26 letters of the crash in a random single single single one .
everywhere , where life is , you will have this distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you &apos;ve lost this ? &quot;
these are the data of one survey to the most successful in zambia in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago , where i &apos;ve got a lot of time .
as you see , bruce prakash had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i had time or it was in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have a holiday in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows you to do that , without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than i was going to have been able to have a consultants when i traveled to two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather .
i promised me that i would go to the world , not to take fuel , not to take fuel from fossil health , to be safe , not to be threatened by the most sophisticated .
i think you need a pilot in the plane who can talk to the universities , who can talk to students , with politicians during the flight , and it can make it really a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that in this mind are welcome to being part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to create clarity is what this problem is , and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we &apos;re the first generation , and this extreme poverty in the eyes can see , you see it over the ocean , say it and i have to do it . we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s a way to get it .
this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the jury , the abalone lobe , and the history of the world looks .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups that are the energy and the enthusiasm out there from hollywood to the inside of america .
step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a boy , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all their lives , can change a country -- and a continent that &apos;s just made of analog , let me go to a little bit of the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
your job is now to recognize what this shapes is , and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just a little bit more , it &apos;s a sentence , literally , wrong .
if we solve a problem or discover something new , we compare that to what we know about , which is unknown .
nadia pratury : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are they dealing with it , personally , but also with their own business ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt like a computer , like a computer , and you probably land on intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for the design of the world and i had to go back to the top of the day , knowing that i would never see my home again .
i sat there and i talked little about the most excited of the transplants , and i asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was standing on a dozen machines that thought about life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these things is also in the united states to have 200 percent .
and also , interesting that the same company , which is sold to 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; and the same company . &quot;
we also launched as a more powerful .
what would our own kids say to us when they were back back to child , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of artificial , some artificial , and a little bit of a bit of a billboard a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the world &apos;s own in the middle of the airport next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single time .
the most powerful thing can &apos;t be formed , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the world &apos;s distribution .
they &apos;re like a mouse watching the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of them is hidden .
you look out of your tree tree and you get out of all directions around us .
redwoods have tremendous surface that expands in the sky because they tend to be something called the brain , which is called repetition .
and the canopy of stability , the canopy of stability , just like a cathedral , helps to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely a little bit of a sudden that &apos;s going to see .
but recently , all doors of the palace are open and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s first look at the most important thing .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how security is working -- and try to find a way to find the most powerful , which we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a little bit down there , and you can see , / d / d , and if you open this picture on your computer , this program will downloaded and made it .
and if you look closer to the images of the scene , you can see that the kind of the brain is the kind of the brain .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though computers are going .
but i don &apos;t have to do it with it .
this person around the consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
this forces are completely disappearing , no one &apos;s the 2011 of 2011 .
it would be good if people were more honest , and they would take these kinds of calculations seriously and they would be involved in this , because this would change things . but it would change things on two of the ways .
that means that we can see a copy itself , if you just use one part of the most powerful , that in slow motion , and a worse more powerful and more likely , and it has a worse amount of energy .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their own , and saw that their video suddenly had spread as a computer company .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
this is what was taught him to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau , which taught me how to do it .
what &apos;s it about today is going to drive you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t know the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , or unconscious , in the moment you decide to focus on something , you can get a meaning , and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have you ever done what , and then , you &apos;ve got , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , so god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through the air , through the movement in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m in the last element . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in occupied area , somebody in new york , who died if he had been at the work of work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and it said it .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools with which a big number of people can tell their stories , people everywhere on the world .
the color of particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive emotion , shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts running , and there are thousands of feelings that have been collected .
the 10 themes of rays and circle around the time time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click that and see this millennium image of betty ford , like she &apos;s going to be the alps of her husband .
you can also look at quotes when you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that is in ways .
in life , they started tens of thousands of members of thousands of members in the entire world .
they only need one step out to go out , and to notice that so common , so that all the other things that are so polite is that all other people are missing it .
so look up , admire the sharp beauty , and think about it always to wear the head in the clouds .
and they would have been put in 25,000 shots that would have made this : &quot; the good , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most popular , to buy my first favorite , and it was a huge machine .
these images come from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see the knife in the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen , which has a very quick , very quick motors in its inner .
this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to get out of the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all that &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly important summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , why we imagine the universe , but it &apos;s going to be the mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
but in my career , it &apos;s always a little bit in me .
in 2001 , i visited them during a computer company .
we got a lot of food tools .
this is what the first degree is in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short degree of the day , and it was recently filmed with someone who all know .
every one is going to have a student , but in different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager in a hurry , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he says that this is the most beautiful brain he ever had .
and the next few slides i &apos;m going to tell you about this .
transistors are getting smaller to allow them to make the technology better .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had a gut gut that we &apos;re doing it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call them the most popular of the most popular , because they &apos;re kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of time .
we can see more detail in our galaxy , as somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it pulls up a lot more stronger than the other and the cloud will be taken apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day , i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and fire .
so for example , people in 9 century liked pieces that ended up .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , this tradition was about what &quot; in this , &quot; god , and to prizes .
through new and more improved instruments , the age of the banana .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael ornish : music and feelings in the course of time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new computer system .
until 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the most important , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was made by a new view of big amounts of big amounts of big , because there are circumstances where these things can really make cool .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; raw innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important .
we get fantastic talks from you .
let me introduce you to this point sam .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how to promote global innovation .
first , i have to make a speaker that &apos;s going to be a service , and i &apos;m talking about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
this kind of tests are using this , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s in the areas transparency , choice and accountability where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , sharon , said , on the world , more photos are more photos of their back than each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the most powerful and the forms of the way that they were being able to be a helpful tool , because they were in specific areas of the way that they &apos;re a sense of a sense of sense .
so i wish all of a beautiful weekend .
dna to read and write , always , is getting easier and cheaper .
and the blink of the work alone .
now , you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a computer factory ? &quot;
if you have the world around the world , this can lead to a computer company , which is allowed to do biotechnology .
the kingdom is , his laws allow him to get strangers , or a more powerful risk or a risk of health or a risk of health or a risk of health or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow in the face for science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a use of traditions and a selective selective .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 of the people who inject drugs that inject drugs .
so social worker , the condoms of endangered , are not being tracking by the police , called the or randomly , or randomly , or randomly .
here are children born , people died there .
office office are now obsolete .
they &apos;ve gone up the high line , the street , the river below the street , and you come from a end of the other , without cross the most powerful .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also jobs should be shared .
their liver makes the oil .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks at the time by actually just a single one of the most powerful in the street in the bay bay island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is going to find the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water and deep .
let &apos;s look at the hyenas , which is what we &apos;re going to do with the genes that are passed from the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , to have 10 less diversity than others .
so , the kind of research , the research , and found that the size is the 9,000 .
and what was okay . we were wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build it . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
so i decided to give myself the the world .
their body will be cut up with the water , and they &apos;re determined to be used for any of the most powerful to make money -- people tell a lot of stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit on other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s working on corruption , and it &apos;s about corruption , questions , people immediately : where are the evidence ?
thank you very much .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the most violent of the world &apos;s office .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a more popular .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their own business ?
today , you can be in 29 states in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality , because of its sexuality .
and eventually , i think my mission is to photograph gay , because there was a million different types of different types of gay .
at least i hope it &apos;s going to be harder to be your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to be good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang , and yang , the most terrifying .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 images that had made the soldiers .
on three ways , the conventional way is called the most common way .
this is stanley &apos;s , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible if it &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
stanley jurvetson and i was both blown up the high school , the james school , in the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other one . the self &apos;s self .
alexander &apos;s saying that the border between good and evil through the heart of a person is going to be .
and i hired the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really very difficult to do .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer &apos;s book is a computer company which is tagged by the red arrow .
there &apos;s only a reference point , which is the body .
i promise that i don &apos;t say anything to say , except it &apos;s going to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , think of creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the hip -- and the eleventh hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell you , and i &apos;m going to make it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can see , i don &apos;t have a fire in fire .
she talked about the most popular , she founded her , organized her , organized her , she &apos;s going to be a friends -- all these everyday actions of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s the perception that the homo sapiens of the former &apos;s life is different .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves who read electric activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we &apos;re going to be a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or a smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the harmful and more sophisticated social systems turn to the people who are diagnosed with people as different .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re going to do on people is changing , and it &apos;s growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
temporary , and unexpected , they gave them .
this is not a specialist that was going to be on the way to study my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and it &apos;s very slow , very slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me , not really , not all the stocks of me , all the little four of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing that the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just one little change in attitude , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to be the way that we have to do the measure of control , which we have about our tax tax .
for the world &apos;s population , you could have put the money into the trains , which is not reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the goggles would have improved far more .
i &apos;m not asking to be the full of the whole amount of the one .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a more powerful discipline to human psychology .
the average answer to 50 percent is going to be in 50 to 60 percent .
it will be a little bit of the time that they don &apos;t even hurt themselves , other people .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that didn &apos;t mean i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had good , really strong effects in children all around the world , and now in humans every ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , which wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s name . i &apos;m 34 years old and have cerebral cerebral cortex .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he has completely written in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a computer system .
there &apos;s a first time that &apos;s the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is that the last ted machine , is something that i &apos;ve created with hal &apos;s , which was introduced to me from my co-author in a previous project , bill dissonance .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people , because if one of the faces smile , the other face is going to be the other face .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we &apos;re doing for western science , math and the most powerful , actually in the first few centuries of our world &apos;s population , and the most powerful , and the most powerful .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not a &quot; sh &quot; .
so it &apos;s not that if you &apos;re talking about mental illness , you probably suffer stories of the world &apos;s disease , shame and discrimination in almost all of the life systems .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world were in the world in the world , and they gave these legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
you see this profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early &apos; 40s , when india wanted to drive his own , as a means to the commercial -- to china , to china , to the public growth of eight , nine , 10 percent , and asked , why can &apos;t we do
it &apos;s not a happy situation , but they have trust and the courage to say , &quot; we have calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon forms together , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are doing , dick , not -- sydney , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual pieces of dna .
and he said he had basically the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the most powerful color , which is just a fantastic aluminum aluminum .
many of these ideas are produced in the trailer for airstream .
if you think about sending your children to the tinkering school , you &apos;ll get with the brain , and you &apos;re going to come back to the brain , and you &apos;re going to come back to the world .
but let &apos;s play it under your own conditions and trust me , you &apos;ll learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the most of the time .
if you want to throw away a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife walking in the left today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely , very much more powerful , not just the sharing ?
this is one of the seven of the seven of the world &apos;s most existing , which is not all shot in all of them .
and so it came to buy the world in the year of the world &apos;s city , and it started to buy thousands of thousands , and then hundreds of thousands of individuals , and then , they were going to print hundreds of individual , small paper ,
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison the light bulb invented , she looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and although i don &apos;t have a college college , that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to bring it far into the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most prolific of your own , both ears are both speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna is climbing .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and i &apos;m interested in systems .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated most sophisticated things in the way that i &apos;ve created a lot of sophisticated .
and i drew their own special map , and i wrote their name on the , and they were writing , they were sent them and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a lot of time .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of the way that it &apos;s a lot of the value , my valuable and limited life on this earth .
in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we think about future technologies , we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the most powerful , which you have different charges .
and by a sequence of the world &apos;s surface , you can get one from a billion fish that is doing what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the way that you get out of this .
if you ask people to ask the question , where do you go to do something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you &apos;ve got to wake up in the morning , or you wake up seven or when you &apos;re up , and you say , &quot; man , i don &apos;t really sleep . &quot;
in the office , most of the time , most of the time , the people who are actually keeping people from work , are involved .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that of employees .
meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe all two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week , no one can talk to you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this now seven years , and i have no idea how the future will look .
but if you ask people to ask the three important things that they &apos;re wearing , no matter what culture , which gender and what the relationship -- most people say , most people , and if they have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the world &apos;s and then -- the owner of the race takes 10 or 20 percent of the front of the store , and there are the rest of the top of my family on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he somehow has a recognition for the values of the line .
at the same time , the spread of these mobile devices are going to see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares us new research , showing how the speech language can affect a human being on genetic level , like , like , if we live healthier , it &apos;s going to be a lot of food , and we &apos;re going to love our brain cells
until i tell you who &apos;s said it .
within this context , we can actually feel regret about many different things .
when i went home after the night , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of us can let us go back to the other .
and as i used to say , i &apos;m a computer company .
i thought i &apos;d try to do my ted wish to be able to do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits to what you &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now there &apos;s at least one million active .
and i came to think that somebody in this whole ngo have to think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to that : less than four tenth of one percent of the ones that were treated , the way they were treated , they stopped their drugs or their treatment .

it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing turing .
and i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we were treating two main pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the readers that are true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re going to go to it .
it &apos;s been done and terrible things happened with me .
all the hope of hope in my recovery .

i thought that some reason that we were going to have been the time and only had to have been left for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the most popular of the computer .
can we say we &apos;ve all discovered symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it out because i &apos;ve built a little bit of a barrier , right ?
if i rotate a magic train , and then one , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , such a symmetry we call it a lot of symmetry .
instead of all the mess , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects basically -- please spell him for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter .
thomas edison had a software software of today &apos;s software .
penicillin was discovered in the world , but even 1940 , no commercial and medical mechanical amounts of it made .

for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos now happens , and we do the best thing .
working on every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus and the text will be smaller .
it doesn &apos;t need to delete them .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by , i &apos;m going to be inspired by my real desk .
a means about this would be something like a computer company , so you get the more traditional desktop , and things are used to the grid .
now i get the heart of people , and there &apos;s no limits of people .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to be able to rethink the role of contemporary math , not just a little bit of a time , but math
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that may have you on amazon .
these are not a lot of the time ; this is culture .
you can get it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic traffic , so with stop , many lives , but there &apos;s a little bit of a little more sophisticated of them .
the answer is to allow cars to get from this page of the road .
warren buffet was struck this : frankly , to say what works and what &apos;s not going to do and do this .
in fact , we see the genetic community that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the only living disease in africa , even several things have been formed to avoid the most powerful .
this means the economy in these areas are being absorbed , because it &apos;s just so much prevents .
but it &apos;s not a more important thing to do .
not only it was weak ; she &apos;s getting rid of it .
a teacher of the top neighborhood is going to be the performance of its class -- measured in a year , in a year to increase 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;

traditional vessels , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought , &quot; a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in a hurry .
when i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to go back to the smoke , and i went home to my clothes as i went home .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .

this is a rate of general in boston .
the gymnosophist takes the sample , the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , and it &apos;s going to be a the ship , and then the operating room .
so in this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a solution , a solution to these automatic molecules , with a dye , is shown green , and it &apos;s a green , and it can &apos;t separate the standard of a cancer of cancer
with the nodes , as part of our today &apos;s , the surgeon &apos;s record is looking for the individual nodes , the nodes , where cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause the spinal cord , and pain .
if we &apos;re doing these two samples ...
we know that &apos;s doable , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different types of energy that we learn .
it &apos;s going to affect the healthy circuits as the sick , which you want to fix .
and one morning in 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been working at the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short thing is that it &apos;s going to be enough to make this cells .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story of the story that we think maybe clinical application might be .
now you can see that the animal actually is the walls and the little platform is going to use and use his eyes again .
buildings are a little bit of the microbes in the air , and the same thing that &apos;s going on in the air and over mechanical design .
and if you &apos;re going out , the air contains microbes that are associated with the most common and dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing , and i didn &apos;t worry about this thing 20 blocks .
the same thing is , the question of the question , who was in the streets of september , was living in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and search in google after that , and then you look at this results of someone .

if you have the second side here , most of you link .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- that &apos;s what stories between generations -- is now rare .

since we &apos;ve been able to put 4,000 most common most common , in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy records of the internet in the internet .
we started to use commercial and mixed using buildings so that all people have centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the most popular thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you that we knew that we knew all that , because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , you &apos;re going to be able to get the most popular at microsoft at 9 / 11 , in yahoo at march at march of march , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden is similar laws , like the united states .

many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different if you &apos;re going to show a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that are coming through the phone .
and the nature of a certain cell , and it &apos;s basically the way that the 25,000 genes are turned on , and that &apos;s what the 25,000 genes are turned on , and what threshold they &apos;re on .
now experts come to play and make basic islamist types of water .
we take the most important material and put it on a so-called so-called a so-called .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genomes and they try to find the world &apos;s own genome , which are linked to the genes .
whether that depends on individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before , everything was right .
and it was made many experiments that all came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to drive politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re working .
poverty is more appropriate than a scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of the impact of the world &apos;s impact , the question of how to get this . but , esther duflo is going to be able to figure out what the damage
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the climate change .
and the legend reported that alexander went through these desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to this from the perspective of capital capital .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of the standard of the standard was called the life of the standard .
if i &apos;d like to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 in 2005 with the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world ? &quot;

i &apos;m going to let it walk , so you can take it somehow and i &apos;ll describe my responses as i &apos;ve seen the first time .
right .
ok , move , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , five , four , three , two , one .
just if you want the pressure down , you make a more powerful , so , but just if you want the pressure down .
do you want to try it ?
and you feel a certain emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the most powerful in the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the field of time .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry shows how our brain can be able to be able to do our bodies -- with a trick of the world &apos;s brain , and then he &apos;s going to be the audience in some amazing moving of brain magic .
i &apos;m going to be a lot of time .
this is not for the one of four . that &apos;s for all four .
i watched that both religious than also , as well as the moral people are obsessed with morality .
the most powerful is almost zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the plague of the brain .
they get the message of the computer : &quot; person 1 sent them to this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is increasing the generosity of the generosity to 80 percent .
i &apos;ve just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we have testosterone .
and that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to promote a brain to the most powerful .
to get the device to run , you need many , many people .
or should you not do that ?
they said quite , very much , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only on english . so we taught ourselves english , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how will this be tomorrow ?
we have to make this imbalance , from threat to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s right here .
i asked a very incredible question -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will it end ? &quot;
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;ve just lost the thread .
and he was in uttar pradesh , and he found out that he was going to run in the official papers as passed up .
so this area is the area of the area .
so , in the privileged layer , the privileged layer that is able to pay several more sophisticated and several households , common .
after those four children , you see the younger sister who are going to follow their children who were killed .
and finally , there was a single one who was sitting for me , and later his participation came out , so i had to get him out of it , so he had to be a little bit of the time .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t get nowhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the combination of the naked hand on the instrument and technology , and of course , what he said about the listening to our young people .
now my career could continue to continue .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the chamber .
or we do this and believe that , that &apos;s blindness .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and the individual of the way that i can do it , but why don &apos;t i do that if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove shows the dove of evelyn , which is what the dove of music is much more than the sound waves on his eardrum .
and it became so big until the point of the last year , and then , in the point of the day , the thanksgiving was a last year , and rick was going to be a million people in television , and rick &apos;s &quot; millions of people
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;ve been lucky to transmit it to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what you should think of .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their height of height and to make all these habitats .
we &apos;re very similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our standard attitude to life .
basically it &apos;s a country that has no more powerful to the beginning of our work .
this is a adult in his jaw .
paul never has been able to see a fossil so .
these are all the things that are all the way . there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i became artists and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;re concerned with this question since centuries -- how to engage these kids in science .
bad news for derartu tulu , but some other people had the same idea , under the olympic , and paula radcliffe , who is a hugely , with distance of all times .
show me a animal with a brain , and the gills , then it has something to do with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest most powerful in the jungle .
now , emily &apos;s -- one of 500 , and the divorced -- she ends up on the eighth place , under the best 10 , although she &apos;s done on all the time , and she &apos;s going to beat the baby to be silent , and to
this is all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen to the focus on this kind of thing , where you have failed , if you need four hours .
in the technology technology , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- with security , not to be a social way of course , which would be , of course , to accept robots as part of our daily life .
cookie cookie is very , very bad .
the remote remote was a experimenter from our group , where they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can be able to be the active participants in life in your grandchildren , like it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple journal with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the most popular , which you normally use when you start a computer and sports sport .
another important idea is that this idea of the character of the character is the character of the character .
i &apos;ve been doing style , laughing , really hard , because it &apos;s not a drum , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot of the n .
it &apos;s not going to go far away , not far . i &apos;m going to go , &quot; bang ! &quot; &quot; the &quot; bang . &quot;
if he wrote on a computer factory , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of advertising , books and a little bit of advertising , all with the same concept .
from photography , this is the most important thing that you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;re going to give you desire and the most powerful , you can &apos;t have the more .
as you &apos;re in the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you change the photo that he &apos;s going to take , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be pretty serious and maybe less accessible .
85 percent of global health systems is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources in the west are in the west .
just treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
but if you tell them , we &apos;re trying to do the same in nigeria , and then all the fort .
it allows the existence to the centers of centers , and we can use the experience very clever .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important to us .
and we start a design of technical program so that we can make local people that can repair the equipment .
autism has a very large range of very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- until too brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , as you all have my projects , and that &apos;s the balls in me .
now , what i learned early because i wasn &apos;t so social , and i &apos;m not going to sell myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
with other words , a problem with the equipment of a computer system .
the movie is called dr .
i made a lot of the school of the school , and i did things , and i learned how to do tasks .
another very much more powerful idea is that the kids of some of the many of the many of the most talented , the children who teach the children &apos;s own .
tg : i have passion for that that things i do , the world i do .
it &apos;s a extended reality , which can track the projections and connect systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i &apos;m standing on this coast , the cuban , i look out on the far horizon and faith , again , i &apos;m going to make it all over the way over the long , dangerous wild of a ocean .
but it was deeper , how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our main system that you never really tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all these talks i had , just just to get the most powerful , they were very different .
thank you very much and fun on the conference .
and that may be the most important thing , he lost his self-worth .
he &apos;s going to be the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium suddenly brings a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they had to synchronize , what other natural agencies knew . otherwise you couldn &apos;t have the right way of discussion .
but there was a programmer who decided that it wasn &apos;t the best way of working .
each of you can do changes and you can do it to the end of the work , even if you knew nothing from the existence of each other before .
this is called &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something significant , which can happen to a culture , is that you can acquire a new amount of energy : the , you know , the way that you can do it , you know , it &apos;s not true . right ?
don &apos;t try to do what other people do , and it &apos;s not going to get it very far .
and if you tell someone that you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months to the most sacred season .
but we &apos;ve tested this rover before we &apos;re going to get them out there -- or this one rover -- and have sure that everything works .
so we sent a spacecraft on the way to mars , called phoenix . this probe is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the way we talk to the next rover that we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have meant that these are really cool things that these are really cool things .
there were two satellites that really interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how this exponentially growing technologies are growing .
so let &apos;s look at how exponentially grows technology is affecting health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there &apos;s wireless things .
and i think many of these technologies will help us be connected to our patients , and take us more time to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that will be augmented by this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is , but exponentially is getting exponentially smaller .
let &apos;s get to genomics when the first human being did the first human health system , the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to the websites , or the other thing that &apos;s going on , or the other thing that &apos;s going on , or the data of their data , is going to be more important , and it &apos;s always going to be more important , all these
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attacks , we realized a more powerful and higher , higher , and higher , the use of their own brain cells .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many people who are going to bend their own , their own , a little smell of smell .
how they cross the plastic tiles , the stage of the road , the stage , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid of a piece of mine , except control of me , and i would be caught for the shocking of her favorite , and i was caught in the shocking of her own .
but i &apos;m afraid that the world comes from and i &apos;m going to show his own .
if we love , you hold me around , around me , i &apos;m there , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are going to drive attention to critical topics , images that are the religions that are the religions that are in the religions , and to do some of them , to do something , to act , to act .

jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books , and i studied a lot of books and studied the world .
i could see what i put the flag on the stick , well , ah , a second moment , and the music went to a computer company .
finally , the morning of the day , we got the most popular thing , we got the helicopter -- two helicopter in the middle of the ice -- the edge of the ice , the edge of the ice .
i knew there were more open water water , and i had a computer company with .
i had known that , but i had a little bit expected .
this is the view of my tent when i got this kind of thing .
and just from the air , i saw the big picture .
and they were in the coast and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the left .
and that said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .

they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more closely than others .
right now , fear is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to look at the future , and the way
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living room of arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses and now we see them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s the people , and people want to be informed -- they receive the most powerful through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as a 22 of the series , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle exactly as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re going to do .
so this is a kind of a sense of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and this is the studies that show that the research is effective , quite many of them .
so you can see this appalling images from africa .
now i say , oh , great , great .
ines is a computer company on the streets , and it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was a old year , when i made this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo play . here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a banjo .
we were with the car at the road , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just sitting in the car .
let &apos;s try it together with this old song , and i sing , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally from the brothers , the later , the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the sound of the body , &quot; which is
well , that &apos;s easier to say as done .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of plywood on about five feet away .
when the new was new , i came to the thought why you can &apos;t take the oldest of the oldest , the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to an ethic .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space , that was for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it &apos;s kind of creating itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a computer company and give it a more powerful and take the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster that talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to let everything .
while five months he was doing it to experiment with a full of a full of a whole computer .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or a brahmin or the chemical brothers , who had played all there , they all had their own casa de musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .

you design something like a mobile phone , and it describes a little bit of a cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you hold for normal dna .
we heat them , add something salt , heat it almost until the most responsible and cool it , and as the most powerful , the short strands of the long and it &apos;s going to form a structure .
so that works really well , and you can build patterns and form , ok ?
you &apos;re going to be in the way , there &apos;s only four dna strands , and you &apos;re sitting on the individual , and you can sit in the other building , which can be put in other blocks , if you fit .
we have a very reactive computer program where small changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and something much larger .

my answer to this is a wall wall from bacteria , which is moving through the desert .
they &apos;re serious to the living of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people in this region are so poor that they are trees to use them as a transport .
and , after the most prolific cost of 60 dollars for bacteria that you never have to pay again , a cubic meter would cost about 11 dollars .
in a time unprecedented population and more , more than a more sophisticated thing , it could be a little bit more like a more sophisticated .
the world shows me opportunities , and i chose .
our goal is a treasure design design , so that it &apos;s completely , and completely , that one single one is basically a single dvd dvd .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , viruses can travel all in one gram of human being .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the acquisition .
maybe you think it &apos;s just good for the people who are going to get shit , but it &apos;s also economically sense of the way that they save a billion dollars .
with horror , she found that the family had no toilet .
and the speed of the pace is that we &apos;re going to make people with sanitation , not reach .

i &apos;ve talked about millions of times about it , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of climate change is the most powerful of the coral , it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
that &apos;s not sold .
and yet , we &apos;re , according to our best knowledge alone .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , planes -- typical , typical .
and what would be behind this kind of thing when it was ?
and i was a little bit embarrassed to all of the time , because i didn &apos;t read the the dune &quot; dune . &quot;
and it was so successful that it was even more important .
and the one is a living small city , and to come to the beach , she said , you need to have a bus and then take a boat .

companies represent goods for households -- we &apos;re -- and we &apos;re spending income to provide income , and that &apos;s even better to spend that income for more goods and performance .
the most powerful , the most powerful , was under zero in 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the thought of five .
and at the same time , the solution is clear because these aren &apos;t that the human nature is going to change .
we need to actually invest in the idea of a meaningful wealth that offer the possibilities that people are developing .
first , it &apos;s going to be economists , so it could never be able to be able to do something like that , and it could be a little bit more nuanced .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited the bay bay in alaska to test the minerals management service service in the ice of their own , to burn in ice .

if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , the two children who may have three jobs or more , and then they have to be able to get out .
we need to do this whole thing like the way that we can find it , and you can find more about this policy .
the first person certainly knows .
here she tells you to a prison star , &quot; afghan star &quot; of how their friends are being told , because they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to go and say they &apos;re going to leave their friends to the democracy .
last year , when i was here , i talked about my swimming on the north pole .
it feels like someone behind you , and you &apos;re going to beat you with a hammer that &apos;s all the time on your head .
and we put ourselves up , and we &apos;re going to go out and we &apos;ve been doing what was wrong there at mt . everest .
and the way that we &apos;re talking about it is , you know , it &apos;s talking about it , and give a hundred percent . because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be achieved if we use our whole power for this .
this is a computer company . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of a kind of a kind of a design of the design ?
so what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a design system -- b -- the b -- the b -- the very simple rules of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students with the communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us are going to seem to be overwhelming , and that &apos;s how we have to be connected to the variety of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware of that we don &apos;t even need to get the entire world &apos;s entire world &apos;s entire .
okay . i also have one .
can we connect to the natural ecosystems around us by putting the rivers back to the example of rivers , and these are the most powerful ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 dead per conflict , a year in the 1950s , in the 1950s , to 2,000 dead per conflict in this decade , so awful that is .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want to do the most powerful .
if not , one of the two are going to be a fool , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , and the world &apos;s world .
and now i have the most popular thing on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad to this , until that so-called big leap after the front .
do you see how you grow ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people are coming out of poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re going to be malaria .
and we need to think of the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it all of the africa . don &apos;t do any of them .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be a superpower around .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- evolution of technology is something that i &apos;m very happy to give you a lot of attention , so you know , one of the first things you had was a little bit of a little bit
my argument is basically that , well , it &apos;s always part of our life .
and this is pretty new , and i think it &apos;s still going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in technology technology , in the brain technology , as a weapons , as a weapons , can be used or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s our favorite &quot; , &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; what was a pretty sophisticated thing to do .
we only have in six countries civil wars , which is , the media just report over six countries .
so , so we should put our money ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , botswana , has been approved by the world .
as this development , we were , the africans , at the edge of the development , and the way to do it in our countries , are in our countries .
the ones that are mostly more powerful , the more important billion , costs billions .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even more .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what life makes it worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re doing different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have a different way of having three different happy lives .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like the kind of time of the brain .
and what you find is that if you do something fun , the most powerful thing is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit fun .
when i was in front of 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to do somebody not depressed , not afraid , not angry , i would make him happy .
a polar bear , which is floating in the arctic , took from paul &apos;s .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; comes out , when all the parts are together , and not only the event , but my emotional connection is coming .
nick -- again with an automatic camera -- has taken thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a huge story on concentrated .
we want to find solutions too .
and then somehow , all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is because this is a kind of a design process that you can see in only three seconds : we can put emily in a period of less than one afternoon in several different ways , and the one afternoon .
emily : image metrics is a computer designer , a computer designer .
finally , i was involved in it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few beautiful primates .
but i was from the west and worked in the east .
all over the time , all of the time , animals were killed , and they were killed , and so on .
here &apos;s the broken , and gold .
one day we met with the most popular .
the elephant just was just taking it and they took the most popular .
i don &apos;t think anybody can be able to be able to be able to do google , because google does the right thing , even if people like al qaeda use google to connect .
and ideally , a hero of the world &apos;s world &apos;s book
we have , almost without having noticed , from a market market to a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should educate them , what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens that share a common life .
and the u.s. as a leading nation in 1900 , because where the line changes red .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women were in the most violent .
electricity was also helpful to women &apos;s suffering .
a amazing fact for the most amazing fact is that in the first half of the 20th century , improvement is three times so fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i wrote with 11 years and i got a two + a half + .
i &apos;ve got some who thought long , between five and 15 , this was my favorite , and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think , is that this sense of the sense of the ability to be able to see the connections that i see between virtually everything in life .
this is what buddhist fishermen say because they &apos;re not allowed to kill a living creature .
and they &apos;re going to notice it more often .
and i had to find what &apos;s going on to the story .
how are we going to be a lot of the responsibility , what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and they have to be in all possibilities , including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you can see me when i &apos;m going to talk to these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you could spend your time .
now there are magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have together is that they have nothing together .
the corners of the line , the middle of the world , is the big market .
these guys represent the most sophisticated of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be a lot of the time -- you don &apos;t have to be completely a little bit of a time .
so what you need to do is figure out who &apos;s interested in that .
nine months later , i was a lot of the messages on tahrir square , and reason for this was a picture i saw in my favorite shop .
thank you .
mostly the cultural legacy tends to look back in us , back and to go back to the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized that you can bring environmental problems into a documentary of nature , i was dedicated to the story of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with you -- i wanted to do another , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i had left , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new kind of design to create a new computer system .
they also were in the field of time .
but the fish came back and back sea sea and the population controlled , grew forests of the life-saving water in the flat water , in the flat water .
now , you live in the jungle of the world &apos;s jungle , and this is a little bit of the time , your second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i &apos;ve saved , the son of the second orangutans i &apos;ve
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without these microorganisms , it &apos;s not going to be a performance .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can actually change climate .
in the world &apos;s brain , there &apos;s a democratic culture there , so you can use the law to protect your own system .
the most prolific barcode , which a world-class one on a computer &apos;s office .
i &apos;ll show you another one .
so , the main thing is , the very compelling sculptures , beautiful , beautiful works , which are moving into the pattern of the pattern or moving waves in the pattern , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s inspired with his own art -- at the same
every city has their own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and develop this idea .
this is italian portal , the canoe park , the most prolific park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but not a case of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t tell the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we need to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the kind of the kind of reality of reality and as an properties of the standards of the standards .
do you don &apos;t find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they could not imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a hippie .
maybe , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , no matter how often i &apos;m going to do .
but we have to change from a industrial model to a computer model where every single school can flourish .
so , the amount of things and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that the historical report is being digitized in the speed of the pace .
there &apos;s a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets .
i stood on , made a tea , sat down and all of it , and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct , you &apos;re going to get the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the hull to democracy &quot; with the data of the resistance of the resistance .
it &apos;s not such a kind of a kind of a thing .
in fact , chris was worried , and said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is , in the largest way , the biggest of the world &apos;s greatest , in this massive , is the world &apos;s greatest , and the other thing that the biosphere is in the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be from the counter -- we call him rid of the impact where they &apos;re increasing the impact , in the denominator -- we call it a little bit of the impact , where they &apos;re going to get the impact
and he was a huge kind of a big design market on the market that has increased our sales and profits .
we &apos;ve literally won the most sophisticated .
but five days later , in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us who work in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and potentially become more nuanced .
and really , we need somebody to convey to us so that we have a experience with a mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , are going to go back to us every time they &apos;re going to be able to look at our own , and to look at curiosity .
the three sisters ahn with her passionate music music , the new life of life , and at tedwomen , they start with the happy and the most powerful , and they &apos;re going to play a little bit of a sudden , fuzzy version of the &quot; &quot;
the manchester &apos;s novelist is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through making special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american , which is in their sense of harvard , and we &apos;re going to be a computer company for mothers in the middle of the city , and we &apos;re in the middle of the inner city in the middle of
we realized that you have to give you flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie , and you can keep the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given around the world , who are flying from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and the good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s really working for today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell them to sell a agreement that says that the money is used to support school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson built her album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which you &apos;ve looked at , and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s an amazing story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill &apos;s being told a quiet and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and then the transducer then brings the most powerful to the brain , and the result is a very , a little bit of a normal , which produces a normal , a normal system .
but there was the most popular factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with a invisible , the attacks of the environment , so that we remain healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and double all of them , they get to make these molecules , then the number of these molecules goes beyond the cell to the brain .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a computer company of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly sophisticated , which is that we &apos;re killing with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they can fulfill tasks that they could never do when they were just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a big honor to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes into the hall .
but if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think about is the actual character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get them out , and you realize it
what a reason you would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s going to do .
so aristotle has a , and aristotle &apos;s and the mess of the marriage , the marriage &apos;s right , the marriage &apos;s marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future human being can make such a decision .
so if that &apos;s what &apos;s called what it is ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the world &apos;s speed is going to be enough .
i &apos;m suggesting that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get a set of people before we get a computer age , and that even though the damage has been the damage of our birth .
that means you have to make your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that &apos;s the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet in the planet , 10 years of the planet .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how we do our profits .
they were in the center of the center of the world , and they put on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a lot of a sudden , which is the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and environmental communities .
the most scary thing is something scary , and probably you know a part of the most powerful .
14 americans die a day at asthma , which is three many like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the world &apos;s 90s .
he apparently had sense of humor .
politicians and the most afraid of the way they have a lot of time to market , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s go . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- you &apos;ll go to this . &quot; and paid people to do each other , the people they saw .
he may think he would have ever been born the baby &apos;s baby , so he might need a little help from outside .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no , &quot; no .
we want to do with africa , the next chapter , &quot; the next chapter , &quot; and this is : a healthy , more beautiful , beautiful africans .
but especially , you have to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect that all ?
we were on the side of the world &apos;s side .
i had to go through the legs of these people through the legs , with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and i don &apos;t often see african employees under them .
the question is , how can we use it from all of this good will , which is coming to us ?
you &apos;re a lot of the time . &quot;
we have a lot of the time in nigeria with the most powerful .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this case , so that we can study it , so we can study it , just like we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try and show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity instead of being involved in the world &apos;s brain .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the internet .
this is very time-consuming and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the thought of the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used and intuitive to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;re very quick . and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a computer system .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria and is a very interesting substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your own business , a very cheaper blue laser is a very cheap laser .
audience : yeah !
interesting , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we never did it , the wings in the air .
this is the restaurant of the house .
this is the most powerful you see here , actually , in a computer factory , which was turned out from the outside and it was made in the outside of the outside .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still from .
the idea is not more sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be a little bit more , because even a smaller genome is going to be a little bit more .
and it was clear that we were , once that worked , a real chance to have exactly the same chance , if we could bring the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria .
so care is a lot of care .
the last one is a quote by robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we live in the northwest , in the northwest , very close to the koran of paradise , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , &quot; and it &apos;s defined by the streams of the streams of the water .
but the more you add to the more , the more lost .
and these number 72 never comes .
this is a nest colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony which has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s a magnifying group -- are a very interesting group . they go from early morning , before the first group on the top of the world goes .
strangely and interestingly , it looks like half the colony colony is not just doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the tanks and bring them to the edge of the world &apos;s brain and put them there .
but the foragers are kind of deciding , not getting out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is going out , the more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface , and that &apos;s how the ants are doing different , that they &apos;re doing different work .
they &apos;re going to cover the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of the world in about 89 million barrels are in about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not to do that .
i think where we can use the natural gas .
and when i was going to get the natural gas gas , gas cells cost nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so , just 500 million .
it never was taken in the ground , or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of time . and there was a lot of time .
the life is a event . i &apos;m suggesting it the world .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built with the first kind of thing .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : the ones didn &apos;t just have to wait and they had to wait , but then the most important , they had to call someone , and they had to call someone call someone .
so , sometimes i &apos;m going to use a rather clinical language and so it may not be so warm to the heart of the world as in other conversations about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the most powerful thing to do for people is to be able to get to the people who are going to be able to get out of it .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less to use the golden rule on you . okay .
and so , the results are going to raise . this is a zero-sum game .
every form of the followers dependence , relationships , forces one , the humanity of the other .
and you &apos;ll tell you that the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t have to be respected and they want to dominate america , and they hate america .
most diseases are related to poverty , but in the case of cancer , children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t use this kind of energy and time when it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant thing would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that these are a single oncogene .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of a kind of a material material that had the right meme , we put the cells in and lo , and in about four days , they were going to see the same thing , and they see what we have
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves where we &apos;re going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a kind of journalists that was caught in the sensitivity of the , a young boy , whose book is so many of the things that you &apos;ve got , that you &apos;ve taken it out of the shelves ; a very fake about fake , in
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new species of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about themselves . surprise !
you &apos;d have four good friends of a person whose personality is aware of their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can lie to the end ; they were talked to me , and then they were going to go .
they told how big the bath was , or said , the most powerful , and so far from the hotel .
and it &apos;s just there . okay , glass , take a picture !
and you want to be able to get your eyes out .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i &apos;ve been able to get out of life for emails , social networks and so on , although it really doesn &apos;t really matter or a little bit more important .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the brain .
and everybody who &apos;s going to get out of it , i went to it .
at least for me , because i &apos;m always doing the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know when i see myself .
will you be nervous , you &apos;re going to be nervous ?
im : you &apos;re worried ? you see so cute .
anyway , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , but only that it doesn &apos;t be tired of it , ok ?
if you have the rigid too long , it will be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- which people are doing different race or groups , but as citizens , all the same things can be equal .
and in egypt , i ended up in egypt .
this had studied in london , in yemen , and he was trained in amsterdam , and he was going to attack a plane to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , well , bin family is one of the richest families saudi .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political goal , and that was , the leaders to remove .
these tools are only social , if they &apos;re technically boring .
he measured the limits of the individual networks and then they then .
and because of social networking , chinese students who studied in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , had the offices in china , there were people all over the world that were heard of these messages .
and finally , the chinese was going through .
we &apos;re increasingly more in a media landscape in media global , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of the time in consider , i &apos;ll still be so choosing as i was doing it .
in my fourth side , everest , a comet was moved over the mountain .
this view is the most powerful thing . the first 600 meters of the rise of base base base base .
and that &apos;s in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck rockwell , another climber , in this storm , was collapsed in the snow , and died .
it &apos;s so much , because up to work , i even had a lot of the clothes in the clothes .
this climber was a lot of the time .
and i can only predict how he did this .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to the way .
these are sidney , the most powerful .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very important for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to participate with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs were to model models , and they &apos;re wearing in great ways to society .
it was a lot of people who wanted to bring democracy , because they put the ideas out of the way they get the ideas of the universal rights , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is the cities .
the second is the most popular , which we have , which is so difficult to create entrepreneurs , to create the kind of jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the field of the field .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to put a modern health system , so you don &apos;t have the most powerful , if you &apos;re older .
you have to be a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to leave the government again .
although some people don &apos;t like to hear it on the left , it actually was the revolution of markets that were used to the most sophisticated : &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the masses anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the most powerful and the ones they represent .
the most powerful .
every one of these things would be statistically , two years after the most prolific .
david cameron , 20 million pounds of the world &apos;s social health , to support this idea .
and the investment of the social change : investment in social change
i &apos;m working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the approval ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; i &apos;m good you , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom &apos;s head and i &apos;m a computer company . that means i &apos;m all hearing what you &apos;ve just heard , just with my voice , just with my voice .
and finally , with this one , i can get my sounds to my right , and i &apos;m going to repeat my sounds , repeat .
our people had to try to find about 5,000 different types of information to find the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right , a computer &apos;s book is a very reactive .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue of the top of the line .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
many of these patients are pulling the most sophisticated .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime and immediately stop .
and i know , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really do a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that goes in both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and that &apos;s how it can be possible .
and their jokes , like the most powerful one of the most powerful , works only within this aesthetics .
you need many lawyers and a lot of time in court , and the accumulation of the world decided that it would be too expensive .
these are the two of the most binary subjects within the logic of copyright protection .
and i want to thank you for this point of view of this , that you &apos;ve made this very powerful presentation .
once i got a boat to a remote , and i realized that the sum i should meet , not a lot of the way that i was supposed to meet .
i think this is one of the most popular and a things that are on the planet .
there are many ancient people on the surrounding , and if they &apos;re going to get a little bit of a sudden , they &apos;ll be able to look at the most of the people who were there , the most prolific ones .
here &apos;s the most popular thing that &apos;s about a year of the year of a year .
i hope i think that by finding these organisms , you can help attention to their remarkable , very carefully , and my part of their own longevity is going to be able to contribute to the same future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals still use mobile phones , but they also create their own own , like this , which is used by the most violent mexico in all 31 states .
what did you do with this ?
what could terrorists do today , using the technology now ?
recently , the fbi has arrested a more powerful in the united states that wanted to use these remote remote lanes to transportation in the united states .
so , as we see here , we turn into the blink of the .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent , if you caught it , but that &apos;s hard .
it will be killed so many people that the only one of the sun &apos;s funeral is not going to be able to be able to be able to get out of the world &apos;s own , from the outside of the world &apos;s outside of the world .
but on the other hand , i hear people how to talk about fear , a certain aversion before the risk .
and sadly , she became 1999 when she worked in colombia with the u , with the goal , her culture and language , with two other colleagues of the world &apos;s favorite and tortured and killed and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to these kinds of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , lightly categories , because we don &apos;t look at profit as pure instrument .
but the entire community , all different of the world &apos;s brain , also the most powerful and the most powerful , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because for the most important , if you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , you feed the world , it &apos;s enough to be in the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of my wife .
why don &apos;t i make your wife , locally produced , locally , made a sanitary pad ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company makes sanitary pad out of cotton and it works .
and i &apos;m seeing this thing in my wife , &quot; why are you using a terrible counter ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access to it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam into dirt , and i swam on the water floor .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers are going to be in my fingers and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you &apos;ve been 18 years old .
the prospect that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years of being a very reactive .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which can be absorbed and can be emitted .
now this may be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace all this with conventional , renewables -- but i think that &apos;s more than the story .
very special material that the abalone shell even make millions of abalone shell , the whole time , every day .
and the idea of this was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of great personalities , which is coming and i would interview .
but i wanted to go to interviews that are different .
in fact , my first favorite was george gilbert , who was 97 years old , and the doctrine was full of life -- i think it can define it .
we know the big amount of energy , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to tell , and the sense of the thing is to make no ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that kind of thing that was the most powerful , but it was a computer company for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was a single one , the other one .
this is a very reactive in the metropolitan , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice stuff .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the &quot; the treatment . &quot;
it &apos;s not the painting we &apos;d have painted , but what we actually did .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we talk about 10 million dollars , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank in the world bank , from the chief of the president , the high officers of the state of the state .
they &apos;re actually going to get a ride .
most of the big companies are now convinced that they need to use very strict policies against bribe etc .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you &apos;re looking at the menu , then you &apos;ll expect it to be all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression on her face actually reflect what she holds from him .
well , he &apos;s sharing his life .
this french painter of the 18th century was known for his life , but sometimes people were also doing people .
unfortunately , these diatoms now spend their most of the time with a series of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a time dinner , which gave her parents to honor us .
&quot; i &apos;ll be a little bit of your own wedding , james .
my father lived most of his time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
and the main thing is , but our movies , they &apos;re stories , with whom our people can identify .
so it really is a young man out there , and it &apos;s really going to be able to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any of the other things .
so , id , so much to say , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
so , the core , you &apos;ve described this as a design industry in the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a little bit of a cd .
now , art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely a little bit more profound .
we show &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re going to go to walls to create new spaces .
so time , the aesthetic , aesthetics , and then the most important thing , behavior .
i had to shut up a few bridges behind me .
all of it is based on the most sophisticated and students who were talking about the first meeting that they &apos;re going to be able to deny a place .
so i made some sketches on the pavement -- little boxes and the things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , is going to be a involvement of a transplant .
and one day i had one -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve been doing the most thin and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the time .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was going to be in things like my house as a house .
she never was finished .
the dome was a wish of the most popular .
it was a trial , this thin piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 on 76 feet -- turning into a property , using these areas , and the space room in this pavilion , with a high space in this pavilion .
they call this &quot; plan grandin . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems like a brain iceberg in the mountains .
our invention don &apos;t want to galleries , so -- and when we met our new titles , he said that this was or the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the foot of the world &apos;s office , which was built by the most cosmopolitan , and the most powerful , and it was built .
can we not make clean burning ?
and one of the things you found was that she didn &apos;t cut .
and this is our main briquettes .
and he &apos;s the problem of health impacts , and it compared to the world &apos;s own wood .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , when this is india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to move things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going to be .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the most powerful .
he married . he had a son called a son called the &quot;
is this business with our outer and our employment with a kind of a phenomenon of the phenomenon ?
i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want to .
we can replace the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with the skin of the skin .
my theme is food in schools , because there &apos;s social justice .
and the next is the next thing .
people are always talking about sustainability , but we should find out what that is .
you know , all of you think you have to always eat more and more food ?
and then they have a lot of the time , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical computer system .
the things we might do at home , and so important to keep kids in the schools , we have to teach children in the schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , two dollars , and 49 cents -- so much money is willing to be willing to take the government for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was going to be a hot school in the sun .
if i go to a party and ask me what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you &apos;ll be matt .
i want to know your favorite , everything about your own beings , and you know , you &apos;re a professional in things that you &apos;re a professional in things .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be more likely to be more nuanced .
it &apos;s a documentary in the mind of consciousness .
when i was closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
where do you know that it was what they did ?
look ? who &apos;s not looking at it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start . some examples .
now , jeff hawkins described his efforts , a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular in london said , &quot; what do you mean with , &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at january of january , and the first picture , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road on january of january .
so , we did these enormous survey with many of the most powerful and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years of the east asia -- from eastern europe , by the mountains of the caucasus , the middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban who are going to be able to get the doors of the people who are going to be able to send their daughters to schools like in the world &apos;s face ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was crushed , i had the blue of the walls on the walls .
and there were two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
now i want to talk to you about some other patients , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about a few other patients , to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded where we can fly to each address .
we are , they &apos;re most of the most sophisticated resource in health care .
and the seawater is a computer system .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with help of sound waves , and i &apos;m talking about the most prolific .
in the united states alone , the annual cost of the cost of the cost of 22 billion dollars , and so bats are going to be in the case of the wealth of the wealth .
why should we be involved in aging at all ?
if you look out here , and you look at the night sky and you see this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be able to be in economic development .
the boom of the raw resources are not all the way , but many countries in the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is there the so-called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion is a very powerful policy .
a few economists just came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to do a auction ? you &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , there &apos;s a billion people in poor or more , and as we can help them ? the economist paul accused is a happy , compassionate plan , with the point of the arm , and the empire of the poor
we have no container where they &apos;re made .
here he is a english surgeons in africa that &apos;s required to take a little bit of the time to take the drug of the brain .
so we have this : imagine , imagine , you thought , you &apos;d have a lecture and could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; foundations of the &quot;
14 years ago , i was in this ordinary material , and i was going to be used to this ordinary material , and that was used for centuries in the same way .
he asks me if i could build this as a little bit of a piece of the city for the city .
so we were experimenting with small pieces of water to create a dry fog that will be shaped by wind , and in test , it turns out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move through it without becoming a more powerful
they were in their own office in the grass , watching the way that they were in the grass , and they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the miracle of the miracle .
so , i was also paying attention to that that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot you see there is the very important place that &apos;s going to be in the brain , which is in the brain .
if you do that , what are you going to control ?
and to say that these changes are also beyond death , even a claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me just give you what i don &apos;t say . i don &apos;t say science can be able to make this room , or that we have scientific answers to everybody &apos;s moral question .
now why wouldn &apos;t this be a objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , you see edward &apos;s .
we live in a world full of technology , and these technologies can &apos;t be able to break it , it &apos;s always easier to break out , as they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk again about well-being in a larger context .
and what &apos;s his natural enemy , which is the means of the good beetle that we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a more powerful , but a half of the activist , two mm long , a quick and agile , a quick and agile .
and if we put these good things into a computer factory , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli , which is 10,000 israeli , biological control , and they were saving 75 percent of the pesticides .
third , to increase the memory of farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
and it &apos;s one of my favorite things .
it &apos;s more fun to make the rich fun , as about the most important , and i &apos;m doing that often .
&quot; urban design &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her name was a little bit of a name of the name , and so that was -- i was not a lot of enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or also the collapse of the soviet union , just some decades , maybe within a decade , after time , the soviet union was the most powerful .
because there are 80 percent out there that really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup , it &apos;s still meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person , a year .
so , until now , we decide to do that , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a little bit on the cost of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be a boundary soon .
and you may think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to be the system , they do it in a way that is going to be the society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a computer company . and on the back , some other gadgets , the way that we can do , and scales , to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is what the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of thorium and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors , it &apos;s a meter of 80 big , you &apos;re about obstacles , and you can get over obstacles and the more of the way .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel are connected to a single axis and so quickly , it &apos;s just going to turn fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics lab of virginia &apos;s tech engine . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
so , as he &apos;s going to do , it &apos;s going to be the first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a piece of imagination is not enough to talk .
in this way , education is very important .
and the most important thing to do is to be a lot of time .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good teachers , and only eight percent of the people of the county have about a more violent or higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty about creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the team on wheels , then it won the team .
but in the last few decades , it was a lot of money that was determined for school school , completely way .
and after that , and the neighbors interview about what they buy and where they &apos;re , and why , is a homework homework .
in this is not impossible to create large displays .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the computer and exploration .
after four months , it &apos;s coming out and now they &apos;re eight months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is going to lead to climate change , like fossil fuels , perhaps even more than this .
when i learned from these two things , i was very , very , both of personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it &apos;s a very good thing to do , which was partly a very good thing to be in the ronald mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
after treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of simple , a series of simple , very simple , to see how his vision is fit .
the answer is motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these research research and hopefully , and hopefully , we &apos;re going to be more results .
and then i have the most unusual of these things for physically disabled records and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i &apos;m going to judgments about it , i &apos;m looking at how this is .
but that was the fall of 95 and then the winter , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s got aimee to the most powerful 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried every one i could , who i could , who , against which , to the cover , so against who &apos;s going on here ?
i always won everything and now i thought , what ?
you can be a big amount of big . take it off . &quot;
host : aimee and designers will be two and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes were going to be the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to see the actual losses of the economy , because we &apos;re using copyright protection .
or to the 2,500 jobs .
and something about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- how in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i &apos;m drunk ? &quot;
in education education , we use about 80 percent of time to teach people how to do three of hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the blogosphere in cars allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing today , and that &apos;s what they do , and that &apos;s what they do , and they &apos;re doing it .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the test .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought specifically my father was dying of complications , and i was in the brain of a surgical surgery on the brain .
similarly , just by the handle of the brain , which can change change of the soil , and with time , a notion of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re saying .
but when i was in the way , and the broadway went along , i was blessed to everybody .
if you design a city in the blind of the blind , it will give a lot of jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to take a breath . &quot;
and the most famous thing that i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is fertile and a you -- and you know ...
you &apos;re going to give money for a good purpose and designed emotional to the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky was written .
so , this is actually the key to me , and i &apos;m actually looking at the key to remember that on the way that the car is not going to be the car , and i don &apos;t go up on the way to the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make a little bit of meaning , we really need to go to it , and we really have to be able to be able to be able to be in the way .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that were going to be able to get this work was to be able to get the way that we have the use of the use of the world , so we &apos;ve developed the applications of the world &apos;s applications in a laser , which is
alex worked on a small , a little bit of a decent , independent , independent report with the name &quot; minority report , &quot; and invited us to develop the interface that should be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to lead this kind of surgery through because we like yellow and more powerful on green .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into the field of time .
we , as humans , are the ones that are designing things and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you for doing science fiction .
what okolloh did was not have been possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line said , &quot; we change this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all good , you make a leap of 20 years , if the audience changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to get . so change and we started playing food care .
india didn &apos;t want to play in the most popular .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get players from all over the way , as long as you got the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but so we had never seen anything . and we had never seen the audience with a song song , for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve done any of them to do a experience of the way and the game , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs because they have fast in memory , like often they have dogs and pigs at the rope .
why about all the world should be in the world ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and you can buy a world &apos;s worth of a big mac , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i give you an example .
and when the way to the other end of the city , 100 bucks is worth 100 bucks , it doesn &apos;t matter , but they &apos;re not going to be saving , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the big and all of it , you &apos;re enormous impatient .
watch what happens when we wake up .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons of the guns .
and so some people look at economists as dumb people .
topic and variation is one of these most intellectual activity that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always looking at the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; the words in words and in fashion , &quot; and in fashion , the same rule is fantastic , and it &apos;s not the first thing that &apos;s going to be the new one , and the last one is the first thing that &apos;s going to be
and i woke up one day , and i said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to give me a critical audience , without suggesting i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to the poster to be the poster , you should not have understood it yet .
so in the big and all of the time , they &apos;re going to be our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell of smell .
if the room was broken , we could see that people are more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in this 20 years in the distant .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need any problems to get the idiots out !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who had to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of psychological trauma or damage to life .
through the whole book , more than an hour , more than an hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it had to seem to be that you &apos;re going to be true , and it &apos;s largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still is about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re working on the spanish , and you &apos;re going to be in the spanish , and these things .
rsw : how does it look like this ?
the most important thing -- they &apos;ve interviewed me for that , and they sent their technical engineering to bilbao .
that &apos;s what reminds me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you go to three months , the ideas are always going to be more clear and live .
and one thing that i wanted to mention in my favorite , but somehow missed , was to thank everybody , the company that helped me do .
but in the meantime , these things win .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the most powerful .
the little bit of the things that are remarkable and things is remarkable , and this is what the most remarkable thing to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five dials and the sixth here is built here .
on this level , around 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer on the world land in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a theme problem .
and wish three is : the most important thing , i was told , i should be able to make myself a little bit , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it will increasingly be more important that we can figure out how to win these resources from these extremely complex things .
the traditional ways to separate material , simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make the oil , it happens with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed of a mixed , many different kinds of plastics and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of the most powerful out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes on exactly the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they &apos;re doing the same stupid as we do .
here &apos;s a vegetarian . it &apos;s going to share a token against food and wait happy , and get your food .
they &apos;re waiting for a little impatient that the market opens up .
now imagine that i press every one of them in a thousand times , and so 10 of them are a hundred dollars of notes .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re really losing a lot of losing .
if we made the same scenarios in our little , the same scenarios would be the same things like people ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development , the dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about buildings , most of the stories are very high .
we need to have less with concrete and steel and we have to build higher . in recent times , we &apos;ve worked on the world &apos;s time .
this is just as much as we have 900 cars less on the streets .
and the curtains curtains , my window .
maybe &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they were up , to fight the decline of the justice of the justice , the citizens of these networks together , to help each other .
and the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the property of the russian government , is now using the russian government , using employees and citizens in the development of innovation with the creation of innovation .
we heard about ted about people who have their plants with the richest , and they work on the whole world , and they &apos;re working on the world , and to make a lot of people , to make the world , and turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and everybody read in their own language , a central , a single one of the golden rule , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do , you don &apos;t want
a pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some of the things .
there are over 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s been taken from parks and sculpture .
it &apos;s made of fiber fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also a few constraints of its lighting .
the bubble is a computer system .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food and we were around the 400 .
as a child , as young and colorful , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , in the form of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m going to be a foundation that i started to build , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is still more complicated called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task , by expanding the problem of death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so willing for school . you were so willing . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense that was the right answer . then they kept asking , &quot; do you think we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest view of the modern times : &quot; the road &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptic and the most powerful of climate change is in the vision of climate change .
we &apos;ve done a project for a few years ago , a big program , it was called the most powerful -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- all of the evidence -- a major design system .
a group of a group of them , they spend it for themselves , and the other group should spend it for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of the time , all of the time , the one that was going to be a man who was going to be a little bit of the time , and he was going to be a
the word is &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about : &#93; stuff : the hidden life of technology .
since this -- there &apos;s four decades of time -- i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , and the world &apos;s best , and old , and old , designed , designed , and the old web , and the most rich web of art
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion , my real life force .
i danced between the computer and i was dancing and i was desperate to adapt to this one of my favorite .
well , it was basically frustration .
this is how it was at the time .
he put it together , and it &apos;s combined to something that &apos;s combined , and then he &apos;s convicted of this software , which i think they were originally developed , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little little little boxes , small boxes .
i want to suggest , yes , do you make a beautiful website . how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a nice website ?
now , you ask the linked data that you &apos;re putting together , 32 hits that everybody is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in linked data .
all this is going to lead two million children every year , and the last year , when 2000 , in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , to collect feedback and give sure that the promises really provide results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , which is 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to define me for drawing and paint .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated with , this area .
how many of you have a cow on the street , and you see the way of bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as humans that are so likely to perceive reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; all right .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from the box of the box .
because if we see somebody running , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that has been made of foreign health ?
obviously , he sat in a cave last 20,000 years .
so the foreign foreign is actually really good to come to the end , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been talking about economists today , that most things are very much more powerful .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a little bit more technical now .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t do it against the memex , so you accept it and find it to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a lot of the time and the water .
pizza will get them when they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of water .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet &apos;s egg , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t put it in the world &apos;s office .
and that &apos;s &quot; how much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in about five societies , people have been leaving this kind of brain structure .
they came home with the day of dinner .
and it was really too strong to a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are the women ? &quot;
no time on this , the women were so educated , so interesting , so that they can do it .
she &apos;s got 23 she taken she since she was 13 .
i started to get to the way that you &apos;re in love with a person in love with the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these diatoms . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it could be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight and the disease of disease -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter &apos;s : what if our views were wrong ?
my great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , to improve life of people and make cars for every affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to be the big problems of cars and environment -- not only ford , but in general , as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
the nurses have to go to data .
this is really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what came out of this ?
and also , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a student was a student , i came to adults who really believed my ideas , and i was going to drink a lot of the things that i was doing with my ideas .
now it was just about the kids . so we don &apos;t have it .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose that they give us to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is that the most exciting thing is that the great thing is that it &apos;s cool .
in a way , in the elegant , or the product of the product , the product of the product that we have , we have a little bit of the day that we have , the most kind of development , which is another kind of development --
if you think about the change in our society , the most powerful of the country in the cities , the 200 years , has taken the same process in 20 years .
it looked ahead , although these were still unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the height of 94 percent of the way .
and how do we do something in this growing world , especially in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , that &apos;s going to build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the most important talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive senses that is healthy and our well-being , without proper darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is that the most powerful thing .
and you see the building building , which was later a icon of modern health .
i think that &apos;s what you see here , and how much light in heaven is going to be , and never reached the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more powerful .
they &apos;re not going to be fooled anymore .
if our main , as some weeks before , a war in a third of india called a war , called a decade of 200 , which is the subject , he &apos;s wrong , he &apos;s wrong .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was on the office , i &apos;d like to see a researcher , or it was in the sense : could i be like a researcher , that would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s going to use ? what was it used ?
to do what ? to break stones , to dig up .
this is the only place where they could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want to be a second choice of standards and the most powerful .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s done in the way that we did it .
i had to be able to do my favorite .
mr. &apos;s favorite , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches of big .
and the most powerful thing , the most powerful .
this is a lot of the time .
these are the wild billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun and the people love it to do it and do fun things .
so we &apos;ve worked very , very hard , but we knew that it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop technology as the acceptance of what is important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for the side of the side , and they &apos;re wonderful to go to them between cities and drive them , but think about it , but think about it : we have all the problems in terms of reach and speed .
so if we could put this box here , we have a solution to the transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
amphibians or explicitly will be revealed that people who die there are somehow involved in drug drugs . that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , that they either were tortured or professional or less .
los zetas are represented as a ties of psychopaths , which are fear and horror in cities and bring the press to the silence , and it &apos;s also true to most .
mexico and the u.s. is now going to be a really international organization that &apos;s going to be in the south and global partnerships in the global distribution of global distribution .
but also part of it , a month of being published in the future -- you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , you tends to be successful , you know , a critical mass of the mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you see the interesting impact . if you &apos;re cheaper , the brands , the most important , the most powerful and so , the most powerful , they win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has reached 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible &quot; is really , you know , the gift of silicon , the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works between the other , and it &apos;s trying to take the best of both .
the second thing was very cheap .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that allowed him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of the men and women , and they &apos;ve been honored by all generations .
they remember , while the most popular , in his blog , the hurricane and the most often , it was often possible , because blogs are easy to use , because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to be a little bit of a time , and i think i heard steve martin playing and said , i &apos;m also going to play .
i wrote this post , and i took this because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to get a lot of time because i &apos;m talking about it .
he was made for a sustainable , except from our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of how to get the oceans .
we studied these fish carefully , but only we had to learn how to keep them .
