but what it &apos;s doing immediately was the realization that our economic development had dominated -- that if the oil price was high , our economy grew very quickly .
we do the same thing in the field of business .
and otherwise i would have wished that you can see this .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that to 100 million people in the next 50 years could kill it .
until recently , we didn &apos;t know how a vaccine worked exactly .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re making a huge triumph of science , because they have the automated death sentence of a single family , at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , research has been done in hiv has helped us very much with progress for other diseases .
this was a slow process , which was dependent on color , which was a little living chicken chicken .
and more dramatic increases and the vast amount of production of the e. coli to say , for example , i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the energy power -- that &apos;s the energy that &apos;s going to be life .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is , why ?
do you think african union is going to organize a conference ?
there are some things you need to know .
the speaker who was here on stage here on the stage , the muhammad muhammad , pointed out that we had the leader of the african leaders in africa .
by stealing it from their suffering .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get aid from the government , and he &apos;s building a second larger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to go down to this balance , because they &apos;re going to go to the front of the time .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new ideas of new ideas and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; well , very nice home , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for more bad , i &apos;m just going to do fun -- but now , just a short repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you a little bit of stuff , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
to the most important of may , there &apos;s going to be a update for 2.0 , where you can get directly to buy the purchase of the fuel .
even then , all republicans here : it should not be about the world &apos;s sake .
what really impressed me about the people on the gulf is that they &apos;re more powerful .
and there &apos;s no one that doesn &apos;t try to use any more except a few people trying to use the beach .
we &apos;ve been amazed that bacteria eat oil ?
this is a little bit of the ocean running around the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they took up at least back .
what &apos;s happening to the birds of birds , i don &apos;t want to do a little bit of a celebrity about people who clean birds .
okay , people who refer to the conservative , if they really wanted to be conservative and really , they should be sending these corporations to the most of the time .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical accelerators .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to get it to the test because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule which we know as a brain receiver .
and this is just a very simple one . it &apos;s much smaller than a human being .
now neurons , as trees , as well as trees , can make new branches and lose old .
and we can even talk about the design of the design .
if you celebrate these numbers , you can make a simple point of the brain that is a big potential for the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to be able to get us from apart and put ourselves in our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on music videos and advertising with his company , which was expanding the most prolific .
so we have prepared a quick experiment here to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of a computer matrix .
you know ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal of a few weeks .
but he &apos;s still doing this .
so his farm is incredibly .
and then he found this wild plant , the most violent .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what is the hell that is ?
at least , i think , anyway .
farmers who rely on nature to find answers , to find answers rather than nature &apos;s solutions to solutions .
and to change the new fire , which means , two big stories about oil and electricity to change both two fifth of the fossil sea in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth cars .
you can let it be quiet : it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and airplanes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and more and so lower , the amount of energy and so lower is the amount of water .
already , in about 20 years , private oil spill has been cheap solar solar cells without financial weapons , and lower their roofs , lower their own .
and what we &apos;re doing is , it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars per net in net net -- although we buy more of it , what we have or new nuclear power , or more , more inclusive , or more
so , in results , and not incentives , to focus , can be able to focus on the world &apos;s solution and conflict to the future solution of america &apos;s solution .
later , i realized that what i had eaten was two of his family , and it was two of his family .
this simple thing is that donors in areas in areas where the least kids are going to school , they have a new question , and this is what we do , and does it take new questions . do aid get the ones that they need most ?
two years ago , at eight , april , 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can this look in every book of my life &apos;s son that life was born four billion years ago -- four billion point of view ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are . one trap : the vertical .
you have time to think , you &apos;ve got time to talk about the art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they come from families , which usually is one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we &apos;re going to bring them to the right and to turn on the left , so they can tell you , and the consequences , if you &apos;re ignoring orders .
let &apos;s go all online . &quot;
it &apos;s immoral .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the internet .
then you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
so let &apos;s take the design of the water .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia at the one of the most of you , you have the largest encyclopedia of the world , and you have the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience shows us that what happens is that this is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold up the sounds of our own language , but not the alien languages .
we went to the age of american babies who had never heard a second language at the beginning of the critical phase , who had been hearing in the beginning of the critical stage .
it looks like a solar bottle of mars , like a solar bottle .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , as art usually has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i &apos;ve got a lonely street over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are the most powerful .
the newspaper table was made of the erotic , a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose with compassion ?
the wound constantly goes across maggots .
imagine squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a computer camera and then we put another more and more of the other .
then , in fact , there was experimental , a computer company .
i am , &quot; he &apos;s dead .
&quot; i &apos;ve been in the way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have any unprotected . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and i saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only thing that &apos;s been done . &quot;
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life wasn &apos;t by ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people were even holding me for a little bit of a bit of a time .
but mostly they went to serious school with organized crime .
this money was in the rubber and the rubber bar -- in bar , understands .
nobody wants to control the world &apos;s appearance and bend his favorite to customers .
some of you may think , &quot; wait a minute . you don &apos;t necessarily see how a football machine looks like .
yeah , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t think was quite uncomfortable , was that it &apos;s extremely uncomfortable to leave his favorite , his favorite .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the challenge of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t the case of the gun .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous about increasing sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable , more sustainable decisions .
brené savage : why i &apos;m going to go through the pacific
this is the world trade on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see a surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about it , that you feel good about places that you didn &apos;t have good to feel .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do somebody , and one day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can put my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers to me , and i had the wrong answer to him .
we were both drawn into the back of the class in the class so that we wouldn &apos;t be fooled with the hood .
maybe you brought your home and you brought your teeth and you never told you , because how can you say you , if you want to be buried , if everybody wants to buried around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at this truck here , it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing source of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now the number three in terms of the number of people per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul of an soul .
by doing that , we remove a large part of our largest health and replacing them with the most greenhouse oil of the future .
the most important thing of their work is the bypass that you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women have put every day on their forehead . it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s very closely related to the institution .
and in the zen shaw , in the wild , in the wild , in the border of cameroon , in the drc , and trained in london .
i hope you can convince them that complex and complicated are not always the same .
the most important thing that we want to do is we want to influence -- the public support for the government .
so i was going to put in my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day of deep improvement for a major improvement of the mood and the more effective increase of joy .
why a game ?
how could a game so much a game in so serious , sometimes , have some kind of fake situations ?
there are four ways of strength , or resilience that causes post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically bernard things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
it &apos;s empowered by practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody six seconds long , then the average factory will increase in your blood , which is the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; aw . &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing it with us . actually , thousands of people are involved in this project , in many of his different aspects .
and then some people came from chicago and said , &quot; end of 2007 , the slogan of the chicago festival is the global warming . we have a 3,000-square-foot square meter , and we want them to fill them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the computer &apos;s not just two concepts , which fit good .
and the first thing asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she did . it was very much .
so we have , from wool , and we have a lot of domestic diet , the proof that the most famous of the math is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive feature -- the self &apos;s self -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at least close and intelligent , but if he sees his mother , his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , they lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , just as in normal people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the most powerful activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a compelling , scalable experience .
maybe you can do the most of the way to solve the safest , the lean in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom and so no more in the elbow , no coughing , no adequate , no adequate , no , no , no , no , no pain .
and the blue is blue , f is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite is to be more of the way that most of us don &apos;t deal with it .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most powerful .
good job .
he learned that he &apos;s using both hands , with his unique data , much larger and more powerful , and can make it a lot more and more powerful .
a frame is a hut in the woods .
look where the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular logging explosions that leave the remains .
on the right , the gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained this .
and it &apos;s going to bring them to new ways of change .
it was still early to early , but he was a moral driver , a inspiration for the control of the weapons .
suppose we &apos;ve seen alien creatures , our main point of our own point of view of far outside the cosmos and not only for 40 years , but the entire four years of earth &apos;s planet .
martin rees asks , is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse , &quot; then i would make a photograph of it and make a dozen of these .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of the money for things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormously different incentives .
these are the most powerful things in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it to each other , were actually the league of other teams and the most marginalized at the end .
if we hear today from the most popular , the high amount of water , we often believe that this is one of these most profound conflicts of the middle east , which is the roots as old as the region itself .
ironically , that was a time when the most of iran was having peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is acting to be able to stop diplomacy , and diplomacy is inevitable , is inevitable .
you can look at certain kinds of neurons or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port studies at the end of 2009 was not as good as they could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and he said , &quot; he was no environmental agent . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also , the status quo , the status quo .
so it &apos;s not about the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to go back the republic .
for example , some people in this room will be , thank you for a scholarship to school .
this is on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit weird .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the mountain .
if you see in north america , it &apos;s like so many things in the united states , and they &apos;re in the u.s.
each of your favorite points depends on this critical region , the most important thing that has been about 10,000 independent cells , which has every 30-year rhythm , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low -- to send a signal to pump a signal .
they were a little bit of sync with it , but they were apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were on the open line , and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually think of it for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and forth .
im : so , this weighs a few tons , so you &apos;re right at the very fast time .
but the most popular scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of a game , and i told you , you should look for your name , your favorite , or the women &apos;s women &apos;s girl .
also , perhaps this fowler or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economic , a resilience against disease or pests or another property that is useful for climate change , and the other ones don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids starving in tv .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and when something happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your body care ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , one lady ? thank you .
you &apos;ve tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one at the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation innovation -- the things are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die from .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the performance cycle space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is a very important thing .
the bass is from the street .
you know that bees and fish live in school .
all around us , a medical revolution , instead of , is a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , including cancer with including .
this is a tumor , dark , gray mass , a peanut mass , a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply goes down to the treatment .
but the real question is : how good does this work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a nuclear test . it prevents angiogenesis in very effective ways .
but even more interesting comes from the study that the men who have developed the most sophisticated sauce , which has been to have more tomato sauce , had less blood vessels , which feed their cancer .
albert von the most famously said that &quot; discoveries is going to be on what all of you have seen , and think what no one thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a witness in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike ordinary problems , which are really very well known to not quite a good puzzle .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but it &apos;s going to go on a computer . over the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction will you fall ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the nintendo , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is to be so powerful that we all had to train , not to be so much .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , struck me .
we &apos;re so used to steal girls of the difference , to be more of their own life , and we &apos;re actually making them objects in the way that we were actually making them .
and they looked at the eyes of their babies and said , &quot; of course , i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual , where she was girls who were beaten up with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t just take the things that easy .
why should they shake me , they want to be more powerful ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and the most important thing they did was they had the songs that they had made by the photo photo .
but the incident came in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to the age of seven a.m.
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what &apos;s important to us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a computer program and i went through africa , where i asked people why they were building fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s going to be in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap .
and it &apos;s just odd .
we have a nuclear war in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of turning to friends or family , they looked at the workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to be widely available to the oil .
the fear of the ride is losing .
we &apos;re going to make a few rules and hold them in them .
the conversation is going to run better . &quot;
now , when i went to this evening , i &apos;m going to start to come here , one of my daughters , and i started to get a ph.d.
and we developed 10 questions .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &apos;s &quot; and the famous first sentence , &quot; all happy families are equal to each other .
i want to show you how to look at something invisible so beautiful .
if i come to the water , you see a silver carbon spill and this kind of light that keeps the water that &apos;s the water that keeps the water from the ice of the car . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla was not by reaching .
one thing i want to clarify is that not all the critics are wearing the critics .
we can turn them down or turn down , or turn it down .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re in terms of understanding what these circuits are , and what the areas of the clinical signs and symptoms are responsible for the treatment of these diseases .
evolution is actually more like a student &apos;s favorite as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being as richard , or a cockroach or a napkin or a napkin , the relative amount of the feather of these feather that we &apos;ve seen to be seen now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it and they couldn &apos;t tell them .
he does that with a solar glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model , and imagine with another colleague of berkeley .
and that was that from the killing people , they were having two thirds of the killing men , but they only have a third of the women killed .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out to the end , and we &apos;re going to say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school , and there &apos;s a woman named heidi meegeren .
and i got my hand back and i fell in all other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman contacted me about this and i looked at her -- she looked at something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as usual as they should , but they do it .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the black .
now i want to talk about this in the following , thinking about how we spread information data in this country , how we get information .
so they &apos;re in clean , clear language . and that works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; it &apos;s good to tell you .
this patient is about 50 , we can say , so quite precisely , how big will its risk be , to cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of audiences in this room .
and this bee certainly had thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing , this flower , i &apos;ll get the nectar and then i get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , which is my favorite topic , how is the idea of the brain ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap water structure : pretty new , a car car , even i could close to a car of 10 ar in 15 minutes .
if a car camera , the grass is going to be on this cut , and it &apos;s going to happen immediately .
and now i say that i want to build a game of games on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development .
if not , the beauty is . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on a certain time , you get your drinks for half .
and then you can do a lot of good things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
so , the main problem is a community community that tries to find the best news that &apos;s exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking to you last time a few years ago .
you also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t have the world too much .
you can see here , there &apos;s it .
this is one of our engineers .
and kant , who actually had to teach students , discovered the law of the secret , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on something that we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re going to work on it .
thank you .
what brunel , like he said , was to get to his passengers , the experience of the landscape .
what does life make easier , pleasant ?
and it &apos;s part of the way that they &apos;re doing this by building a great new new device , the basement of a hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been swept up and are actually part of the present problem .
and as brunel can , we can have a lot of power to do , a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter was surprised with his boss .
mark , and i &apos;ve tried to have a series of studies , right now , to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the european , the ambulance availability of all these sort of things on the market was like a giant .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choices in theory seem to be more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just for this short time , but he &apos;s got so much of us .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that goes to translate . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant , very elegant . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re problems that are controlled by forces .
so thank you very much .
it should replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a more powerful , and we can test the amount of power of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is not being understood as a more than a single car movement , but as a result of movement .
the bomb &apos;s going to enter the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear force , which would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and give it to your car of your television , and you get it out to the outside of it , right ?
if you replace the word blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very right that his perception is very , very intimidating to you . let &apos;s see .
i think it was this exchange that led to cotton .
ph : i hope you can understand how to get this .
and finally , the race has won momentum , as the phone company is going to be called the phone phone .
mm : because it has given the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where tv is what &apos;s built , what &apos;s going to be built is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the cooperation of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can be ordered simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think i &apos;m going .
it gave me an incentive to -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk to us and build some installations .
the use of the city that has laid into the public space is significant , almost a international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , after all , i was looking for some of the design and the design of the chair that i &apos;m showing you , i &apos;m going to show you the same .
he said , you have one of the new ones , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to be high in the position .
i knew , but i was in the office , and when i looked around the offices , where there were a little bit of the time , there was no one going to come to the idea , to turn , to turn , to turn , to make
and congestion fever has spread in the field of food .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember just in a school scanner , i read that the first one is called the first one , which is a very appropriate number of cases , about 52 miles long , about 400 percent cases .
we need something that was really , really , really , really valid , so he doesn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males are female , a lot of offspring .
so , the most important problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t take a profit from most of the time , even though i &apos;m a computer scientist .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now build a story of our online culture .
bill ornish : your health depends on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
that &apos;s the reason that no one &apos;s talking about it .
as the dawn of the dawn is explains , plants are moving phosphorus from the ground .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a kind of a piece of view of nature that &apos;s going to be the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is going to be lost as they said .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that is going to be given in a few of the world &apos;s rights benefits that we &apos;re going to go through the world &apos;s energy .
and he was a so-called , &quot; he &apos;s a &quot; -- he looked at all the other things and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps repeat , but they &apos;re repeat without being a plastic force .
as an architect , i think only about relationships between the pieces and all of the , but in terms of design change , it always becomes more a matter of business .
we were on the level of the building of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on 60 floor to a single mass of mass .
and again , we come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually quite honest as it goes to rainforests as soon as the rainforest .
the difference is mostly in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most powerful in the desert , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been illegal and now on the air .
we have doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just just by building the vast problems of water quality , and in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important time of energy .
but we can do it and get opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest largest business in the world &apos;s world .
work together .
so -- what &apos;s the system that &apos;s actually about solar d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
all system is not taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological degradation to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the world &apos;s brain and let others get the pristine , and we have the signal -- two other ones that we gave our hand -- signal , giving up .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically to carry in .
this is jesse and he &apos;s going to press a computer .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely completed , because 22 million people are living with hiv , which are random 70 percent of the 30 million people around the world .
governments in front of the place have to create effective , major aspects of ethical aspects , which are approved in the different developing countries , and they &apos;re being adopted by the government and the most powerful of the study .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with are a too high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet criteria that usually like people .
so you see this electricity coming north -- the most popular in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this is the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful thing to go up in the galapagos .
we also know that not only are the most profitable , but the other oiled election and other things .
now i want to show you that penguins are moved in the field of music .
turbo has swum , with his eyebrows to pat the door . we let him go in and see it here .
and then there &apos;s another one who comes very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
and the two parts of a very long frontier .
again , as in mongolia , russia didn &apos;t conquered russia . it &apos;s a lot of it .
for the u.s. growth of america , china reduces its most sophisticated , so that it could be cheaper and cambodia , and they &apos;re cheaper to sell in the cost of the oil .
what i want to do here is , i call a day , day to day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow from the computer , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza stripes .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of the european union look ?
53 countries and far the suspects are straight lines on the map .
this dream is his time time .
does it make him bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
okay .
and the hormone turk is increasing growth .
so how can a hormone end the rate of aging , then , to be saved ?
we think that insulin and curvature are hormones that are active in the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is safe , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
and in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of that i talked about , which is very quickly going on in the worm , a different normal computer system , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they will never see a display , because nike wants to buy their shoes .
they all show heroes , the most sophisticated ones .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a design of a design .
this view is that many of the major people &apos;s most powerful , like prozac , essentially change the chemistry of the brain as if in fact , the brain of a chemical soup .
and my colleague , seymour , seymour mcchrystal believes that too .
and we found that a piece of mutant , a lot longer needed to get back to the top of the world , and when we were putting the genes in the mutation , we could discover a role of a game .
and this question has been asked for a long time , but we can actually test it in a lot of time .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark by letting us get it . they smell us .
just to see it , this is the cheese .
people actually said to me that they &apos;re being bitten now from mosquitos .
in the field of music .
and every time i was honored to get the damn damn , the naked hits of me .
and as a result of the , fat is one of the best sources for adults .
while we talk about , about generalizations , about 65,000 times , we &apos;re going to run the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when what happens ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about that , because i stopped the headline .
brené kumar : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , with help of the material that is encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it &apos;s expanding this , but it can &apos;t really go , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not put in stone , but changing as the animal learns by experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to pinpoint the identity of critic until 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the world &apos;s business and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example , as intelligent behavior of physical interaction in the physical interaction .
here is shawn , or actually a bioluminescent piece of discrimination .
ed : yeah . tb : okay . a little bit after , a little bit more to the middle , a little more .
i know , from any experience , hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite legacy of legacy .
i &apos;m telling you , this kind of extension system , which is all of the way that it involves your goals , the brain &apos;s brain , is going to transform the change that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime of health .
they stick not like velcro , or glue , or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc ornish built the most powerful thing .
what would happen if you climb on the bottom of the piece of paper and you would come up with a kind of a , or we would shake this sheet ? &quot;
and so , i &apos;ve done it . and he does this .
of course , it &apos;s completely different than you would see in a wooden scanner .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say that people are working in the oceans and think about the goals , we should be a lot lower .
this is the ship i was in antarctica for the last three months .
if this ice rises up the sea level , it goes up to six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for coral islands are the highway islands .
you have water water .
but then , at the end , you see the most sophisticated thing in black .
we have very interesting possibilities that we have in the atmosphere of the atmosphere of millions of years we &apos;ve always done this with a problem , but in this case we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : find out how the gravity works .
einstein has already been in room and time , and biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of the room , so the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello can vibrate , they can actually vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical apparatus that may be able to explain some of the more cosmopolitan of the world &apos;s traits , or can we actually show these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colored dots .
now , can the predator see the predator that &apos;s in the field of attack it ?
and what sensory information is true is generally true to all the information .
and we look at about 30 seconds of what a hammer is in a 18 minutes long .
why ? because if the one in this shadow actually would be in the shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye would reflect like the little outside of the shadow , they would have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and it comes into the hive , finds a blank blood and hand , and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right right here or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we also are a storyteller of storytellers .
now some things : understanding security , the risks , the dangers , the way they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the way to accept data that we &apos;re asking to embrace and reject data from our online data .
i know a different group of people , if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people who are .
and he was found in the near near , stanford .
they had good points with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to figure out if that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to get a person to get them to get them or save them , and i found that i could do something that nobody did .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert ornish : building a park in heaven
and groups were very often called &quot; terrorists &quot; and they were very often called terrorists .
they need a more sophisticated process with the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about the first time we probably get to the first time in the arab world , a revolution , a revolution .
the paradox is that the next decade was so promising .
so , in once the ngos , ngos don &apos;t call their slogans anymore on the streets -- they took them into negotiations , because they were taking the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good thing .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new computer table .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the nazis come , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer , to a number of people , a lot more people , as i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , by simply comparing the genetic similarity .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is very connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single type of dna as a human .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of them , or some of them are in the face of the world .
where we really have to get up , the process that &apos;s going on is that the process of the building is on the level of the world &apos;s level of why the body doesn &apos;t heal itself , and it &apos;s usually doing it ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : how cancer is understanding by proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give people to give up .
because at stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . never before have anybody tried this .
in fact , martin luther kings was at stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i do nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they got the most sophisticated out , and they tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
and automatically , we &apos;re going to do the little little bit of plastic up .
these are the ones that are designed , and they were designed to do so much as they &apos;re doing , to make the control for the ground , they were not considered a permanent building .
they &apos;re the stability and security , which can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them to the zodiac construction of a steel niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of the brain &apos;s gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be a reminder of , to bring compassion to the discomfort of suffering , that otherwise otherwise otherwise promises us .
gandhi also was a really serious person .
and the first day , our main goal was our very early , and taught us our motto , which we had now had to use every day for the rest of the summer to make the distributed movement .
this is one of two or three of your known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without imitating the other thing .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s face to learn .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that you &apos;re going to be a core picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very sophisticated circumstances , and my parents didn &apos;t have higher school education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to have incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s an initiative that is on simple , head , and the solutions to the answer .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to try to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me and i said , &quot; you know , i remember you , every generation , you have to do better than the previous ones .
i know many people who are very smart and yet saying , &quot; why can i not solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with a different family in 1980 .
don &apos;t you think we have responsibility here to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , as well as before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make a difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball basketball , and this basketball bar represents her identity , which you are .
when my kids were little , i was always in their room , sat down to their bed and looked at my kids in sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had -- i was doing three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we then have 100 laptops , every one with one different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10 books .
right , the famous chinese character for the internet revolution .
you answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re feeling feeling wrong ?
we really learn the very bad lesson .
think about how it &apos;s a moment to feel in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that everybody hate to be in a audience that would never be .
the effect of this is not just the only thing that &apos;s not just the wheat of the wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer to this was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main system sank on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the hindu river , our culture of the stream has tripled our transportation system .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often going to hunt in the west , as if happiness is something we have to capture , a thing that we have to capture , or maybe several things that we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions so that our employees can live their lives .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
and under deck tells you the inner ear , you move your ear , but the eyes are moving in unison with the boat , and say , &quot; i stand silent . &quot;
amy , you come up to the top ?
the way you did that ? the outcome : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and allow them to express these too . so , amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people have no opportunity to have this opportunity .
we went thrown into the &apos; 70s .
and to come there , we have to realize that the principle of a brain system is not just the way we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is being denied .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure someone has already wondered , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at davis davis and received a lot of attention to it , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall down and they end up here .
i mean , people ask themselves if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. martin &apos;s , the most salient mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural media systems , where they &apos;re not going to be a step , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing foragers in our bodies .
first , a design , they &apos;re breeding with a plastic , which is called the &quot; death death death team . &quot;
i was only months later , who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive when you can . &quot;
even with this , in our hands , we have the hope that we have to get the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
he suddenly knows that he &apos;s been defeated .
to give you this , we have to put them back to the driver &apos;s side .
we &apos;re going to put it in the field , we &apos;re sending it to people , we send people into the building , we &apos;re going to be able to get the building from the inside , the first one , where we &apos;re going to find the first
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details . in the contrary , i could write history here .
you &apos;re going to be accused of public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and what &apos;s a democracy is that it &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is better than , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of life expectancy in things about two years of living .
what political change do in terms of the political change have been introduced .
china , i think , has always been a few very specific , more powerful principles -- especially in terms of social capital , public health care , a sense of equality that doesn &apos;t exist in india .
it was a place where people with the people with the most of the time and with various forms of dna and they were moving .
and now you have the problem that you &apos;ve spent the whole money to do the money with this progressive electronics in these countries and now everything is very different .
a slightly chaotic environment , where many ideas come from , where people are more , interesting , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , more of them .
about a decade or two decades ago , a wonderful piece of paper named howard &apos;s name was to be named howard notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it &apos;s going to do it .
is that the other way to go ?
in the 1970s , this was a one percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be summarized roughly in the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political changes , which help a group of good interconnected technology , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money can create the money of money , it &apos;s much harder to grade the whole thing .
so they &apos;re going to invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern health system .
that &apos;s his little hand .
we &apos;re going to die from one of them .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed a new development .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you &apos;re going to be concerned about medical care , and you can eat a toxic dose , just half a percent of people have ever done it .
so , long talk , a long time : they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most of our time , how much of the most popular disease , how did the good and the bad ones together ?
some articles even went so far to say that skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , but that &apos;s the way that metastases are spread into skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s that these are the most sophisticated tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is that skeletal muscle is perhaps capable of controlling angiogenesis , that the tumors that are able to turn that blood vessels to themselves
this is a very far idea , but i really believe that it &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl , which was the other thing to do for her team for her team .
and i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a march , who had 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all of korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this the window , look out , and look like flames from the page of the hotels in the height . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bath , and we took them , and they were holding our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through . a year ! what &apos;s going to need for so long ?
that &apos;s your favorite .
this is sydney , who will be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper , basic point , in which the science is that science is , as we know it , to redefine it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the kind of the thylacine , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all right , from here .
thank you very much .
look at , while uganda falls down and zimbabwe falls down , russia has been on one percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in africa , and yet they find in senegal , here , the same rate , the same rate in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be something else , which is the more common one .
we know about 16,000 billion people ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
they have to give me just food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions on the future billion , in a short part of 82 , when the united states is losing its place as a number of economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the giant , regardless of the giant , the most powerful , which we &apos;re going to have , regardless of the signs that we have lost our work and other parts of our historical heritage system .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of spider silk .
spider spider silk is almost entirely entirely out of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider is quite diverse .
also , a high potential for the ability to get a lot of the capacity to the power .
what i want to pay attention to is not the mermaid , so lovely you may be , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the connections have contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is starting to change the first thing that is always changing .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
she was made by doing the way that you &apos;re using the use of the use of many of these tools , the world &apos;s intelligence agencies , and i &apos;m sure the intelligence of the world today is the same work for attacks last week .
you have a lot of time , which is probably for us the smartest part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made out of fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; aw &quot; .
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the kinds of connections , which is a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use every kind of spent a garden of a garden of every beer .
it will be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a product , while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to give my hair .
it &apos;s presented by brian &apos;s paints who is an extraordinary artist .
that &apos;s a little taste of the song .
what we did -- betty , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two cds with food : a bowl with a little broccoli , and a bowl with a diabetic &apos;s grandmother .
i mean , last , when we look at babies flat , they seem to be quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies each other other species .
the main thing is that it brings them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be dark .
&quot; babies and small kids are like the research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist , says , sweeney : the legacy , as babies are doing , as babies are doing , as babies are doing , and make decisions .
if i could just take you for a little demonstration of a little demonstration , to show the difference -- it &apos;s actually quite valuable .
then you repeat this process , and again , again , until something is coming out of the way -- in this case , the character is going to be the way i walk .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do anything .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , like he got shot .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it yet .
some studios are already using our software to do exactly the same thing , and we &apos;ll soon get a few of our data in a few big spots in a few big spots .
we thought he just would keep the balance .
here &apos;s learning to go to the top of the road -- like most of you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to developing empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times , and then you get hundreds of emails . most of which are coming from , by frustration .
some stories are just classic , but yet , it &apos;s so tempting .
it &apos;s been peeling . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to create a new empty document in word -- that might happen !
but i think there are actually two microsoft &apos;s microsoft .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard .
and then , if somebody writes a little bit of a text , what happens every day -- i say , &quot; fuck me . &quot;
but when i looked at the technology technology , nanotechnology , and other things in the world , and in the world , i &apos;m very worried about the most powerful way of doing the most powerful thing about the world &apos;s brain .
and to turn the danger of this new stuff , we have to ultimately reduce the ability of individuals to make them in principle of access to the access to the target .
i think the challenge we &apos;re standing in -- i &apos;m sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , are we going to develop these kinds of data that we use from this device that will take us out of this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all sorts of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of the last , you know , you have a little bit of a little warning of the last , and he &apos;s been at 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s right for us .
and if you use the concept of insurance needs , you can have a much more powerful entity -- the circuitry of the market -- to use feedback .
12 years ago , caves began to explore me , and i moved my research into this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a social form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there is actually a huge number of oil types .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many characteristics that were used by people and other organisms than habitat .
whenever you &apos;re a goal to be able to take a destination , you have to start to start with some steps , and you &apos;re going to have a certain contribution to it .

it was made of a joke about it and it suffered under extreme amounts of light .
that means before we could start to digitize the book , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by flying up the electrons with light bulbs , they give them x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip von macedon had a son named alexander who was the great , and she lost the battle of the computer .
because in the moment , institutions are going to be with the data with the data and so forth .

at the beginning of this year , virtual asteroid was sold for a compelling real dollar .
the really interesting thing about virtuality , is that you can measure it .
well , i could create a game called the name of the name of the name , just by getting a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial and virtuality is amazing at it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , 1999 -- there was a video game called the &quot; aw game . &quot;

it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of the hydrogen &apos;s grain and the big bang of the light , of chicken mcnuggets , the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful in america and the change of the way we were agriculture international .
this is a very important thing that i &apos;ve got two years ago , which was one of the largest projects that i &apos;ve ever been involved in , and my company ever involved .
but i &apos;m going to get limited to the beginning of the process , on three very , very special words .
if we &apos;re so good in what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s absolutely fine by the most powerful and the more and more cosmopolitan of the water .
the architectural use was said , &quot; simple , simple . &quot;
and this is the real secondary effort .
the second technology we used , we use things that you know about the most of the way of an opera .
here you see the most violent configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you make stories , in some horns , in some ways .
one of these projects is about a year .
these are the images automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a little bit of a game . well , further .
a more nuanced cluster of a laser .
an 11-year-old , a farmer farmer .
what if you found the truth of the truth , what would you do next 35 years of life ?
&quot; money , and a business open , &quot; was the indian media industry .

if someone looked at a black board of 1993 , the most important thing has been a little different since the time of &quot; love story , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the south of the world &apos;s brain , and also in the most popular fashion in the lab .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t represent existential threat to global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a tense orchestra .
diplomats dig up in the field of music .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success , was to be the big part of our success in our humility -- in the careful way of doing this .
rory , she mentioned libya .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you a little bit of how it looks .
there are also also more sophisticated , the rate of the rate , but if you &apos;re going to get these online spots , these are used for a different kind of plastic type .
the most important thing . this is a hard problem that i &apos;m not going to be going to do .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is lead to valuable information on a general basis , pretty bad phone phone .
so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal food that we probably can do to make things .
and we decided we shouldn &apos;t think about that as much as the cost of thinking about the cost of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that is called &quot; what &apos;s the most appropriate thing to do with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who don &apos;t have that much as you are .
so we can think of things like the most sophisticated .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half if i say you &apos;re in the hospital , nobody thinks that if you get to the very hospital , if you get to the missing , you know , mri and mri , mri and vice versa .

and there was no way to be a professional .
religious ornish .
harder , it &apos;s the dead to move the dead .
my friend simon singh , a computer scientist , made a master , wrote the book &quot; the big bang . &quot;

but it &apos;s been inspired to think that these guys , at least most , the most , what they do for a living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .

but my experience with islamic world is very different .
so , there &apos;s a figure for example .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of desire .
particularly , in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting , that there is no way there &apos;s no food .
this is her favorite and fulfilling , which is biology , the natural instinct .
and then it starts to start the desire . this is a study of curiosity , the learning of curiosity .
you know there &apos;s a erotic space that everyone &apos;s hearing alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a more mature cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .

how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring to language ?
albert einstein -- i just went to talk to somebody when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .

he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely have a powerful mind with the authority of jesus christ . &quot;

lg : like , i &apos;d like to happen .
licklider &apos;s computer fiction realized computers can do the necessary amount of influence to make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our own existence .
these records were human rights .
by a more productive process , what &apos;s going to be a task for 40 people was about three months to become a simple job for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all wins from the street .
we should stop seeing out .
dinner with my wife and the children after home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i &apos;m not going to be open . you want to be put in .

in the era , we have more than katrina .
and they all have this , and if they don &apos;t , they will have to .
help me make green to the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical about what this kind of x-ray of these things are .
in this case , you take a laser test , you put it on a pile and the pile of the pile of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , that &apos;s the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
if kids like flowering such projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought that great cars , a soul , is very useful . they all know that . they see a car with the first sight of the soul , and they know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite favorites , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper instead of giving a studio and six or seven apartments , in malibu , in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt a very close one each other , we broke out , and we were blown up strings , and we &apos;re going to be the concept for the real nature of true design and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve been working at clinical trials in four of these diseases .
we have no team of the world &apos;s and we have a team of dna that can actually mobilize us on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to think about is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so , although the universe continues forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be moved moving , there &apos;s a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it &apos;s cooling down .
it &apos;s a very heroic fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something that i &apos;m going to do out there , like me , to say to africans and the poor who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what &apos;s going on in my real world , just with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bike bike , and i put him a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a sudden , which is the projection of the projection .

again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep under the earth to build a subway station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have these terrible water systems .
we &apos;re under the average in the city in the city .
a city of the future is a city that nobody can lift from this great community , which is cities .
the best answer is to reconstruct a darwin &apos;s brain , and to reconstruct our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is , you make beautiful , so you get a kind of attraction , so that you &apos;re making pleasure , just to look at it .
and some are in case to be big , to use it for the battles .
our strong response to images , the expression of feelings in art , becomes the beauty of music at the sky sky at us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try and explain it to explain , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here the computer that the environment sees , and because you can &apos;t see the cucumber , we can even see the driver , and we actually can see the driver &apos;s driver &apos;s &quot; going to see what &apos;s going on . &quot;
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid you .
or for the blind people in everyday , in everyday devices , education and office .
a subtle double system had begun . the most powerful thing that ordinary people don &apos;t hear , and i heard them , but i was told that something was not going to be true with me .
my mental health was a catalyst for a computer scientist , mail and physical and sexual health , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , it &apos;s easier to cure , because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia . &quot;
to be a drug member : when the social change begins , it cannot be delivered anymore .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars is also a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s the way that the life of life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another thing that was going on , this high piece of furniture with creatures and the naked and naked -- pretty creepy things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned them into things that people would use on a new way , and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most important thing is to be in awe , that we decided that all of the technical gadgets are , this whole thing , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example , which is all together in a room , which is the three-dimensional design , the ideas that the brand of brand , it &apos;s all intimately interconnected .
this is my favorite anthony anthony in switzerland , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to get it back . that was hard .

and if it excites you , why is this interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that is really worth shared the males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m coming from , which is a very , very , very sophisticated republic , we had a little bit of a , which is to be the universities that protect the universities against the college students .
if i was the only person that thinks that we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims saw europe , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. became the efforts of turkey , to join the eu , in turkey , in the states of muslims , while some of the world &apos;s countries were supporting countries .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be able to get it to anything like that .
if scientists today , a century later , they want to make neurons visible , and then they &apos;ll light up that one , rather than they &apos;re too expensive .

his power , wealth and greater freedom , is a lot of freedom . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to reduce income income , without changing the political framework .
the freedom house found that , although 50 percent of all countries are democratic , 70 percent of them are abstracted , in terms of that people don &apos;t have a throwaway or a more profitable .

is this the internet actually a place that you can visit ?
and the landscape changes . three years ago , when i started to deal with it , there was only a cord along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .
and that &apos;s not what i &apos;m really sure .
this data will be sent to the phone for layer , starting with the basis of the product , and it puts the material layer on layer , by the new layer of processing in a car process , on the old layer of the old layer .
it was made by the purple of layers of layers of about four .
a rustle will probably be less likely .
you can just make it right in front of the place .
this is what the product is made .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is creating a revolution in production and the most important way we &apos;re going to know it .
he was worried that when he called them at this name , especially outside the public , you could think , he would be defending his attitude from jihad .
they use his mailing movement .
the good news is that it &apos;s not to be .
but many of these factors that played a role are even more powerful , and half of the work is done .
i was with my friend susan , photographer , photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months of months , the time is going to be going and forget , the time was very much more powerful .
but it &apos;s less likely that they remain .
and during my first year there i was going to continue my company .
it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to be needed to make a solar cell as you &apos;re going to bring in all the time .
solar cells are taking a four and a half hours of light .
and they &apos;re also under great pressure and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a very uplifting thing .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , the generator and all the most popular , and this is the hot hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder at the top -- that &apos;s hot , and it comes electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool down .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we have no obscure , this energy as fast as we do in the moment .
we &apos;re bubbles it and we see the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we did in the region of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poems , and he never had the air in the air , but he went to cuba .

td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different obligations , i &apos;ve been given , and when i was young , i was always going to get my way back to my journey .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should also be done on internal level .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , because of everything you &apos;ve done , so that it &apos;s happening and i was pretty nervous , and i was pretty nervous , and i was very nervous .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others who have learned it in the reality .
if i say , &quot; we , &quot; i &apos;m talking about the advice of the ted .

some of the poorest countries who have most experienced with h5n1 , have collapsed farms , who have already gone up .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do very much .
i &apos;m happy to answer your questions .
our centers for the most of them have developed the tests of them -- as rapid as they &apos;re a rapid event .
and in the most sophisticated fashion , they were similar bacterial infections , also no problem .
don &apos;t just pay how much fun you have , but also how the energy flow completely changed the way that the energy is completely changing with a city like san francisco .
please put a video on me .
i &apos;m going to get a boy from a force , and he &apos;s a guy who &apos;s a little mail to sell me three clubs .
i &apos;ve been playing a truck for my childhood , and i &apos;d go to the air , so that &apos;s the case , so i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m a hippie .
manhattan doesn &apos;t take more into infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she was one , driving me on the triumph .
because of the trees , and branches in the wild , it &apos;s very dark and very quiet .
i &apos;m interested in the very dynamic of the world &apos;s design , and i &apos;m interested in the dynamics of the design of the world .
we &apos;re advising us with the media on the media , we have a design system ; we have a design system .
and then the students in our recording studio came to our recording , and they took their own little break of their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and ourselves learn to grow the frog , which is a very much extinction of endangered species in the states and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve hidden on you . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for the growth of the world .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and this day , i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
the breath is the air in the air , breathing the air from the air .
each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are going to get there , there &apos;s an reserves .

and its communication and social interaction is improving so much that he could visit a normal school and even a more mature school .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re only in it , you can &apos;t get out again .
i know you never heard of him . but notice this day , you &apos;ll hear from him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;

these are the key evidence that life can be in many other environments .
so you have to think of the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , to be deeply able to move into a touch with life elsewhere .
so it &apos;s so important to silicon , and we will expand it in the future by expanding it in 350 antennae so that it &apos;s sensitive and to restore moore &apos; law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the most powerful search in human health .
many people say it &apos;s the best place to study the world change .
every cylinder is a very big time of time .
while they &apos;re going to be able to put up the ice , they &apos;re warm up a little bit of gloves in an oven so they can attract a new couple of gloves if their food leaves are flashing and their fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit more dramatic to this point .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really care about them , to go to pipelines in the wake room when they actually have reported to service for service , to the service of american health services .
you can still push it , and the efficiency almost triple to some of the people &apos;s efficiency and the distribution of the great bang of the great world .
we could build bigger cars , which would be the security of the power , but it should be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have our own environmental system , and the other ones don &apos;t .
and by the way , the price of the design mass mass mass production of this kind of materials makes , or in this case , to make the difference of the brain &apos;s , as good as a good business system ; the most powerful thing that can do
it can &apos;t just act about a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have .
hope , we &apos;re really stable .
oops , i turned out wrong .
at the end , he found a newspaper chief , a dutch computer company called han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that was about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite , he looked at him as if he had discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive they find them , how much they &apos;re moving to them or romantic , depends on what they think you think about .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it brings to the story of its story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his head of his house in a subway station in washington d.c. to put on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock painful , because you &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to see , you can see that there &apos;s a kind of political capital that is going on .
they &apos;re doing that that they &apos;re a scaling , professional member of the american state of the american state of food , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is that people who eat vegetables and olive oil , less , have fewer more expensive .
the most amazing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very important conclusion , if you give a drug in such a high dose , that there &apos;s more side effects , and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the answer .
that &apos;s a problem that we have right now .
and very soon , they would have begun to get this coal , ton of tons of miles around tons , to travel , and the world &apos;s , to go back to china , back to china and everywhere .
can you imagine how you would feel if you were on my mind ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , all knowledge .
this is the thing that the world &apos;s most important , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , ambassador .
these christians are the most terrifying .
they negotiated . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them on the morning would be bent down to his child and it &apos;s stealing and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all that has enormous implications on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did have a very good thing to do .
for the most important thing in the audience , it &apos;s actually an important way to explain why the consumer budget has a bigger budget than comedy . that &apos;s because it &apos;s easier to be in other languages and cultures . so the market for these films is larger
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. history of the united states , which is about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everyone is here -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifelong commitment , which started growing up with the gulf of the gulf in the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are on our living environment , are only by belief and guess .
one is for thousands or millions of years .
we have to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. wilson : saving the lives of life
another more and more profound , the famous european quake .
the genome of passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion pairs of base pairs .
the reversal of the recovery falls into these categories .
real falcon from lightly , bacterial chicken .
there &apos;s a program that &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional topic . some people got up .
my grandmother was a calendars .
i also made my own comic comic , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw , like you tell you .
&quot; rather , jarrett , i &apos;ve got your head of control .
i &apos;m going to publish a children &apos;s book , &quot; the police police police call &quot; police police , &quot; the world &apos;s computer . &quot;
sound affects us all physiological , psychological , cognitively , cognitively and more resilient .
this is a 32 million pounds expensive , important , important , which was built recently in england , designed by a british foreign company .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say , don &apos;t sit in the team next to this team , because the noise like the noise and the other stops .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business company that &apos;s carrying his life in suitcase , and the dream between the dream and reality and reality is not able to convey either .
and the other set of frames and four years later , and work later was what started as a design of a talented actor , a very talented actor .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create an intelligent , important and extraordinary piece . and then we went ahead .
if you look at the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products more , like a little bit of the internet , like a matter of internet , and the other thing that &apos;s going on , but also mirrors .
and the protein collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it in fold .
i &apos;ve found 185 products in total .
and i am like , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you have a long and a long time ago . &quot;
i told them , you should be able to do that , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they have given me the feeling of being somebody in a time where i felt like no one was a guy .
they &apos;re working on the ninth copy , so they started in the middle of the city , and now the letters carries p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of the mind , or &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; .
so the puzzle is , why are we going to be polite requests , uh-huh and threats so often ?
you can imagine what if language could be used only literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with that .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s going to make it a little bit of energy . it &apos;s a little bit of a game .
what &apos;s the realization of that , to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine an argument where they &apos;re going , but also in the audience , and watch the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most important part of me : we want you to get us to the world of nature , and we bring a design design and finding the master &apos;s master &apos;s master , which inspire us to inspire us .
this changed everything . it &apos;s not a lot of these engineers in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .
that would be a solar problem for fuel cells , if you could get up without platinum .
this is not just because life is just a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
feel and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer scientist . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , as the design of the tree , smaller amounts of carbon in direct terms are in direct economic terms .
and the world &apos;s not exceptions in the world .
people are making it all of these delight and this miracle .
i have a nerd of a jolly , happy , and i &apos;d like to get rid of the adolescent cows on my own book , and now i want paper paper to make it a paper towel .
we &apos;ve got it off first .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with them , i realized that they have adapted to incredibly well .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , after they finished , and the campus were left -- and certainly , they were going to come up there -- some time later , and discovered that crows still came to remember them .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other to do things .
so , for example , squirrel would come to come to look for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a nuclear reactor .
who would ever be imagined ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen because every region has an offer .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future , and you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot to taboo .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s sound of sound .
there &apos;s about 10 million of these oil projects .
and over here , we see the radiologists of israel , &quot; how the hand is in a way that &apos;s in a way , and it &apos;s kind of remembered in a way that &apos;s remembered at the kind of glass . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d rather eat , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should have an experiment .
he had a line in his book , who was supposed to be born from the top of the world &apos;s book , and there was a very , maria maria , the difficulty with conception .
so now you have evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you , what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d like to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment that in the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had was , my shoes was too offensive .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know exactly where the different colors are going to be made .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; bye &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little bit fun , and before i left the room , i was scattered a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was one , so my youth was so interesting .
the song as simple as a mere fact .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; wait , well , is it good -- i &apos;m going to buy the wheels . &quot; from protest , i bought the automatic wheels , and i built them and -- look at me . could i please please get my favorite
it just sounds like , but i think we have a huge deal in our society and culture with intent .
he had been designed himself , and he was really proud of it .
human beings , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet already on seven billion people are living .
and he was very proud of the stand-up seat , which he was really paying up to the top seat , and he had a very mild seat on the seat of the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- lived in the original thing something better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i rented that she was lost , all of the things that i didn &apos;t do yet , but not possible .
and then i started to ask myself how many times i had been to ask how my life would have been different if this man didn &apos;t have me injured , if my genes had a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now in spite of a computer scientist myself , and i suspect i suspect i was going to myself .
i had been hoping to be a lot easier to be , this turkish nazi , to get four words to the four words and to make me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his family prize for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we work with the machine &apos;s machine lab at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction with the robot is intuitive for you .
and yet , i made this idea to shake .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we have to find a solution for this problem .
some of them actually put on the speaker , like , nathan atwood , to speak , or by the way of tim ferriss , who may be considered a very hard thing .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes that .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found the task was a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all sure that the expansion of the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the mind because i &apos;m going to call you three main principles to string theory .
the candidate list went on about 10 to 500 .
and he worked for decades , and he &apos;s going to explain this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has additional dimensions .
because the astronomers of today by turning powerful telescopes to heaven , a handful of hydrogen atoms discover photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to do it , but you &apos;re really interested in making more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : that &apos;s dimitri &apos;s right in the way .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is coming out , armed men , there are a lot of water on the street .
it was a very grim meeting that was working on the the war who had been working in war , and of course , the great , brave people of sarajevo himself .
if i asked , why am i going to go on and do why i &apos;m going to go , this is the reason .
but it &apos;s my job to break this testimony and this is the most important thing that the core of the thing , for us , reporter .
even before a goal that you &apos;re trying to do with the joystick cursor , the cuban cursor , the goal of finding the goal , no matter where it is .
basically , we trained the animals to learn that they were able to control these things , and study objects in virtual world .
in a experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju did the most complete thing .
raise your hand .
the last reason that women have part of the solution is not the problem .
in the niger , in a cut of seven women , in the middle of a child , it dies .
it was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry chaplin , when he was a member of the world bank , once he said , &quot; it can be good that investing in education in the developing world are getting the highest food supply . &quot;
this is bill mandelbrot &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre of our own brain , which tells us that there is a more powerful thing .
and even this picture makes sense that the suspects had felt , to be a little bit of the flavor of the book , and , by the way , the kind of thing that &apos;s about the most natural &amp; amp ; e.t. .
one of these possibilities was that we could have gotten to a little bit of the time .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to trade this arrowheads against the finished arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can meet all three or four miles a new language .
when 27 individuals were 27 individuals at a table , their 23 languages were going to be able to give them a simple , and they &apos;ll tell them a simple thing that they need a army of the sun &apos;s worth to be prepared to be prepared for all
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they were also about language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and the other image , and how the image is changed by text , and the text through the image .
these are the most profound , highly correlated , running across the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
it &apos;s going to turn the negative .
but by the way of the idea of the brain , the most important , and the brain &apos;s , and the food process can change the production .
larry chaplin was sitting at a 10 years of a 10 years old camp , in arizona , for the kidnapping and the convicted of a young boy on a top of a young girl .
before that , people are leaving themselves .
and they brought them to us here for the texas .
and now they drive with the food where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast part of the space that makes it look like nothing .
this is something called addicted to a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part , the legacy of the legacy , the discomfort , the pursuit of happiness , was driven by the pursuit of the individual , and can be driven by the realities of the individual , and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a more powerful thing in science is that happiness and bad no matter of a continuum is not going to be a closed continuum .
it starts in the field of water .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one possibility to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood , we have a little bit harder to do .
you can actually heal t.b. , even people who are hiv .
with knowing that a patient who remains microscopic , until 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be saved by many lives .
here we see neurons .
so the important thing is imitation and emulation .
now , the question is : if i just watch a different person being touched , why am i not confused and have literally seen this kind of steel of being touched by the naked , how someone will touch ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not about the most sophisticated , but it &apos;s the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken through a scanning block by the way by kew , by kew , .
even every single one of us has a story to tell you about the most powerful thing on us .
we have to be so good as the breast cancer system to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s when we were to go to women and death through heart disease , they wrote an essay for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the most important , x-ray , x-ray , for women who have their breasts on the heart , every time we put something , and that &apos;s a little bit of a small amount of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , we started here .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve given them , they &apos;ve been brought up with a lot of services .
the cells have something like this , and they feel like they don &apos;t feel the native .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , and we collected about a quarter of a quarter of the year of water , and the most of them were going to be a quarter of the year .
this is one of the first ted , which is a little bit more than a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project , philip , saturated , and orville roy , are here to see .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time our son did more than two steps at once -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to be a very important question , because the better we understand how the brain makes meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to this . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams all the time to paint the whole wall of the whole wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about sanitation , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s no way there is .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a window of a window and a window is broken , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s got to be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;ve continued to cut .
are we just stupid ?
you might be playing through it in two years when you read eight hours a day .
and you can say , in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the firemen to get the car &apos;s car to do the vehicle in pieces to bring the body to the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the present of the united states in the united states , which is an eye of divinity .
all of this leads us -- the only thing that we &apos;re doing is to name this : that &apos;s what we do most of the digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the health system .
he gave my jaw to the right position while he was putting my teeth on the right position .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who is fascinated by the gaps of being in mind , whether he &apos;s hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing , or a blind the movement , or a paralyzed movement .

and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on the side . a big of africa and the most of africa .
and then deng xiaoping came up and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of search with the data we can copy in a plastic form and put the world into a field of view , and what do we hear if we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned there francis crick .
but there was what was in the literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was obsessed with , i was not married . my girl didn &apos;t get married .
you can actually compare it to dna and compare it to the normal sectors and the calcium sectors .
and so i close by saying , by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at the age of schizophrenia .
average costs , the defense in such a case is two million dollars and takes 18 months when they win .
first , they don &apos;t fight against the patent , but against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of the patent .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the fathers were on a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their daughters , and they could reach out their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and we needed a different way to eradicate polio than we had done with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic pandemic pandemic pandemic , sars .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible thing happened .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce ornish : how we get polio to be a standstill
dj : we found this parasite now at all kinds of animals , especially in the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a very uplifting thing .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of a lot of inspiration , a symbol of this hope that belongs to our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online issues , the most sophisticated , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to do it .
after all , it seems to be obvious that the earth is big and perfect , the sun is small and mobile , but it &apos;s worth the point of what &apos;s worth a rock rate .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle world , there &apos;s always the slave .
nature &apos;s model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between them , there &apos;s no consensus between their favorite , more cosmopolitan , the most of the way we see it in middle world , in middle america , and they find it .
people like a machines like being scientifically scientifically scientifically , and it &apos;s a very , very much time , but it &apos;s a waste of time when you want to guess what the person will do next .
over night , i was going to be in the wheels of 40 years old in the wheels of 40 .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these very little videos to see videos of the robot and to send orders by putting buttons in a field of a car .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream .
in oceanography , for example , in oceanography , for example , a major lexicon of the world reserves is developed by basically the most sophisticated , the dolphins that are sending them out .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot glass of water .
there are now some -- there &apos;s some lessons that you can learn from that .
but normally we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really is sad if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i be interested in this ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence , make sure that states never go home to terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war is fragile , 20 million people who took life -- until today , the civil war war worldwide .
dr sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time trying to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken in fact , in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started to go on university in new york city , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the most powerful search for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big fit .
when the suburbs started to become less , i was clearly more depressed until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember to have a child to have to go on every line ?
18 and 19 , i slept at night .
again , i &apos;ll get a little bit depressed and more angry .
so many of us are clear that there are a lot to do in the next years in the next few years .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that led to the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you announce the impossible , you can do it .
but we have reached a agreement to climate change .
and there god was crying .
the most remarkable thing is , they use two ingredients , proteins and water , that are in their spinneret collection to create a material that is extraordinary , comparable to technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re kind of like that , you know , beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch the camera .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , marilyn &apos;s birthday , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that could convert the dog to the dog and convert your applause to the body -- hopefully not -- to help him meet some of his closest decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this still unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a very more , more than a more powerful thing -- it &apos;s taking the feedback of his audience , and he &apos;s doing the feedback of the crowd , and does this thing work on the
stanley milgram , inventor of the famous world &apos;s book , thought of the most of the world &apos;s favorite , and the most powerful , and the most powerful , that there were two to seven steps of a relationship on just five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships are about very much more sophisticated groups ?
but there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have to put this license in the ear .
um ... my dad , a football machine ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about life had been in spite of his young age , and also his fault , to be a more powerful , a design , because he was out of a camp , while his friends were left , he kept his whole life .
and as my 15-year-old and my favorite student had given up , i was sort of accused of orphans , made my father wrong .
i asked him , given the victim he had , if he ever had the ever ever .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people we &apos;re today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a very beautiful system on the top of the mountain , which is a very , very good thing to do with the next thing that &apos;s a good state , the seemingly in a good state .
if you &apos;re going to go through the forests , the border of land goes around , you can be able to stay the ability to stay stable .
with the realization of the knowledge of the discovery , fishermen , the most great barrier reef reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is bloody under the current of the current .
but the drama is of course that it &apos;s clear that the fact is that that &apos;s not an option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like media of all kinds of things .
this is a kind of a race of a race from far developed .
first , he uses a ancient way of making the world &apos;s brain , and he &apos;s connected to this three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology at that time .
and by the process of sugar on black , i hired portraits of them .
it became very big images and i took them with a very big camera , a camera camera .
my interest on the most of the time , especially worse , is very far enough .
further back , a sequence is also the chimpanzee .
we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and the oil of india ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people today .
we can then get the two questions for the probiotics , how to have the neanderthal : have you been mixed with ancestors today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of vision , like this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine a carbon carbon station in the 3d printer , and are embedded in a pool of a nervous system , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t talk . but mostly they were extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from people .
they would be a police officer . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research you have , really , is a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent these experiences with that that i started to start on this area .
then you go down .
so , you know , you &apos;re going to put you in a stare of shoes -- chin on the top of the brain , poor extended over your head of food .
they did everything that we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile class and they do what you call &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re doing wrong .
people also have changed .
i said , &quot; where is it ? &quot;
this is not a mess .
and she showed up on the left , to tell me how problematic this picture was , that it was for you with the idea of the idea of black , which was a black statement .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most important thing that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
now , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you do that before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their main school is growing up in 50 , which is the other time in new delhi , to get a biotechnology biotechnology .
and 76 percent . when the test , two months later , was the result of 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be a computer da vinci .
these are 2.4 .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the opposite side of the place , which was falling out of the moon , which was measured by the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
now , i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they are privileged .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most sophisticated tool that we have , and finding out what price people would pay for for it , so they would have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the most important thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroy two main pieces and 10 tv doors .
the little computer company to remove it from his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is all right . it &apos;s going to be slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models i work with .
tissue of the density of breast density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to use these models for the design of the world .
thank you .
now , trying to fly the way that the trial is going to be a result with the beginning of the end of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , so that we have a darpa , which is like a darpa , the california institute of technology and university of california .
be careful , behave just like wood or so , just like wood .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a lot of life .
they go on forever .
these are over two billion .
it takes him to think about &quot; three years of &quot; three years of oil . &quot;
don &apos;t forget , one more time .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time where we live in the human mind and machines .
i really have mass . where is it coming ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that the way in free wild could go extinct to 30 to 30 years .
all the evidence of photographing this is that this cancer is going to be transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity true and took a few samples out of jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other body parts .
she took him to the veterinarian and discovered something like this .
and ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability of our cells to share and adapt to their surroundings .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be a little bit of the way to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation is not happy to do .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers are on them .
first , i &apos;ll show you the most popular for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken if we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is gradually coming back to the age of half the world &apos;s population and to afford half the global economic economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of war .
after repeated the soviets , sputnik was called &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or the way to be the world &apos;s rise , it &apos;s going to be different than if you live in beijing in beijing .
and if we have strategies that we &apos;re going to get in more historical context we will be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a more powerful amount of money .
this is the conventional approach .
this typically has the responsibility to be the peacekeepers to give up a stable security crisis .
they &apos;re more recent than each other .
who ? especially for young men .
after most of the laws of law collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to the ground .
the supply would be taken from the own , to the conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown new orleans .
the military has realized it . they call the climate change , the security and stability , while governments are discussing in the world , how to react .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford the insurance itself .
these are inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to plan to plan a world that &apos;s going to be a world .
listen to the chinese students english by shouting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with the more powerful , abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , we ask ourselves , what might be , what might be .
luria saw people before they put in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a distorted world of the concrete world .
and the experimenter said , &quot; the north pole is always the snow .
they chose high-resolution rather than new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively hard professions .
would you have killed it to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re looking at me , a degree in something to do .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifices , this film , of the movie .
i &apos;m one of their favorite ones .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister , secretary of secretary and a cfo , or president of the world &apos;s book .
boy : the most serious thing is , it &apos;s serious .
we were all angry on them , &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be much real if you read it . &quot;
we had played the game for a few weeks , and we &apos;ve been able to make about seven weeks , and we &apos;ve been able to decode all 50 times the crisis .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good paying jobs and they refused to be the most profitable thing .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all had three legs of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a tetrahedron .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very , very , very powerful case -- this old , very energetic , and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; , this is a very simple thing to do in a old fashion .
this is possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , galvani &apos;s paper -- you can be in a school school or a state school -- a leaf , a ruler , a pen , no glue , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple amount of energy .
this is a little tube , which is what you do , is these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a steel machine .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they got bored , so the captain invited them to be a deck .
in the conference conference , arvind gupta shows simple and yet amazing plans to turn waste into really , very good , building toys in really , good , building toys themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many evidence have been provided .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can actually make a place of traffic in a process that offers open space for people who bring people to food and waste waste in opportunities to get the streams of information .
this photo was done at the day of the day , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you &apos;re blowing seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to go through the people &apos;s souls with visions . &quot;
i was looking at somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish , and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there was a lot of men who wanted to go from me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he would like to travel , as long as it &apos;s not on a car conference .
i was trying to basically be like the design of life .
because you remember my favorite , you have to get a $ 700 of 700 points and no one did .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the most advanced demographics of the world &apos;s media , the gamers of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine that your vision is very , very good .
these gamers even have a lot of other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also more improved , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this outcome , and to put it in the context of another group of the world &apos;s brain , a group that is actually in our society , which is the high school , which is the high school workers .
let me explain this step with a task that &apos;s called mental disorder .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just all do the kinds of specific programs that we &apos;re looking at , running .
so it was a big , very complex project that i wasn &apos;t even sure if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , formal language and a large network of the capacity of the human capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so , with physical energy systems , we &apos;re kind of used to go to the world and recognize that certain materials make sense for certain technology purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited at discovery that there are candidates of universes with incredibly simple rules that have a special theory of relativity , and also the general relativity theory and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more family , and teachers who are growing me , hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there was a woman who was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a really good job of property and automatically , and everything my family had , anyway , had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were excited , and i was excited , and had no night .
he was wearing a full and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have a little bit of the street . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything you would like to do after me .
when the marriage was pregnant , the mother was made for it , and he was punished .
while we &apos;re talking about this , 125 girls will never be mutilated again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of american gdp are actually starting to pay attention to the only way banks and companies are paying attention to their own , in the daily lives , to break themselves in everyday life , to get us forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually step back and basically the future of education , the future children of our households .
so , in fact , the prison &apos;s gone up to 48 percent , and at cornell .
we also observe a trend to something more sophisticated tourism . right ?
one of them is the most important community of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s growing up the neighbor as a support of support .
we &apos;re also watching a big deal of dna .
the trend to the design system is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of kogi .
and then the question came to me , is i the only one that does this ?
you could use them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main movement could shrink . our hearts could be 18,000 , and our family levels could be more powerful if we &apos;re constantly within our cultural cultural heritage system .
and i came there for the first time i call it &quot; representative foreigners . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a sports , or i &apos;m going to ask , why do i do that , but the commute between languages is allowed me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge deal , because i was being retired .
literature must lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that will be a happy story , and i may write in my next book , and i may write about a more , gay professor in norway .
so you can do it . you &apos;ve got existing songs , you &apos;re going to put it in little bits , and it &apos;s going to get these pieces together , and you get a new song , and you get a new song , but this new song
instead , these laws and laws worldwide use the more awkward comparison of property .
it &apos;s a very popular , white , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it does . the alarm alarm : the telephone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not within .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is you probably can see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a light limb coming out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a sense of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so reactive that atoms have a single core , with a very simple part of the bacteria that circle it around .
this picture shows a galaxy , a more nuanced , a , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually be the most powerful ideas for us , and we can do the value of our home in the universe and really the value of our home .
this is here . this is home . we &apos;re .
and with every mouse and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to leave you as a little touch and nieces of our personal information all over our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat on the top of the day , i asked her , &quot; will you be able to put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do the obesity of the african .
well , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i was so excited about this , and i decided to go on my gulf my gulf that i wouldn &apos;t talk to you about a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t speak -- ?
and i explained to help of a friend who understood my sign sign that i was john francis , that i was walking through life , that i was not talking about that , that that was the last time he would translate my sign sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack back again .
i started talking again , because i had a study of research .
but the most important thing was that i was thinking about my silent , but never to use my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried about that i would get back and back .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to eat in america so much , but my father died of hunger .
but i firmly believe that your gesture of love and care can be saved by another joseph , and can change thousands of other people &apos;s problems that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much more powerful than i expected , and just to screw up and make it easy to make it as an industrial model .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , the contractors .
and then in the next year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder , what is a permanent and a little bit of a temporary building ?
but this is really needed .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the certain language that will be talked to the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of the presence of the presence that are so different and weird how the woman itself .
why should malnutrition to bear in the womb ?
you can also see the other way to see it , but you can see it with other eyes .
this confidence in the brain system is essential to every kind of conceptual .
the audience will be on the top of the world , which is really logical , but not with the sign of what &apos;s happening before your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe it &apos;s going to be a smile .
you may remember that as the most powerful , the most exciting thing , right ? at the time the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the somber , and someone says , &quot; what do you do for eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is playing .
for me , all the music became .
now , if i use my software , the camera is looking at the top , and the point of the computer is going to be the same time in the process of the world &apos;s brain , and you have a pig .
i remember the poor needed something to be a little bit more powerful -- food , clothing , shelter -- whatever they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a moment of shame .
now , there i heard him talk about a lot of reasons .
i didn &apos;t even have asked a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the history of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage what their dignity would be like to be able to do , a partnership that is based on a traditional way of a donation , can happen crazy .
it &apos;s a very much more powerful combination , a very strong combination .
now , the first thing is , the very first thing is , it &apos;s very clear , and it &apos;s very clear for me to realize that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now , i turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate of the rate is even doubling 18 months and every single child &apos;s member of the world &apos;s law , which is the moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they float in their abdomen over the sky , and occasionally they haul people to experiments , who would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
the previous generations were not able to do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was found in the form of the world &apos;s first technology .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i see a lot of the time , and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t have any of the people who are not alone .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a stand-up gang , but some of the changes for climb of trees had gone from trees .
until now , our knowledge about our ancestors came from the most of our ancestors , because the fossils , the most playful , are missing .
the most salient of the heinz historian explores humanity &apos;s origins in the vast ethiopia of ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa about our humanity .
and if all of you should be able to keep the rules , of course , you need an effective system to print and the search of the way we &apos;ve noticed it is also necessary to control .
it &apos;s considered high seas because the continent has been beneficial of the risk of the disease .
we need to work locally , but also the entire industrial system is going to be a lot of fishing .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol &apos;s favorite says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
that was a pretty good idea .
to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we need to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and everything after that .
it looks like oil spills .
the symptoms of complex , you have the strong and more powerful opinion , which has the right solution to have no idea how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried writing an article for the new york times and explaining how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the insurance rate of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and do it . probably everything goes wrong .
it &apos;s immediately off . &quot;
farmville was always trying to do it again , but he couldn &apos;t prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not sustainable .
china has been going to have a long time in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even go down to slow .
the future is completely inadequate .
yes , it will become ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen soon -- with security in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s on us .
and here they come into the game .
and what we need to think about is that if you &apos;re in the flames , what &apos;s going on next ?
and we thought we can lay this debt on our children , but imagine you .
everything else is a computer .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should not be amazing or ?
all we have is a little bit of fusion .
you &apos;ll be able to focus on your own , maybe you can get the sensitivity to the sensitivity or not to be able to do a series of things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a thousand years away .
we should be able to ban these cheap simple , simple , simple , simple , and no one to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this general .
we can &apos;t risk the risk of the customers .
he only got 500 and could have been able to get a thousand . &quot;
and he had a huge amount of labor full of the body that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way the web -- things we all talk about -- is something less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet since more than 5,000 days -- the web , but only 5,000 days .
so if we say the machine we &apos;re going to be in is a human brain now , a human brain , if we look at the rate , there &apos;s six billion of these , in 30 years , six billion of these .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a chart and things in work , a word document , they &apos;re not part of the web but they will be part of it . they become part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in some sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , if you want to be dissolved .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be able to get .
third , it will be ubiquitous , and we &apos;re going to fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i convinced the second ted system was taken by jesus christ that it was sun respected moon , and that i was in particular of god and i &apos;ve been prepared to become a lot of his life .
these are the dead of the deaths .
and it allows everything . it makes all sense of it .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we can line up things .
this is a project we &apos;ve just done in a huge fashion for a huge scale , which came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that develop it .
and that &apos;s exactly what led to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are doing in the education of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a more successful thing .
each of you is about to turn to his neighbors .
so as we should have high school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain &apos;s brain .
this is very , very important , because there are pcbs .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the great brain , taste and reward , like you know .
he said , &quot; you know , sometime , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can still name 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the most sophisticated monks told us .
the average , the post , the post , is actually a very , really , a very important thing that reflects the light , which appears to be the light on the sacred valley of machu picchu , which seems to be called the &quot; adorable picchu . &quot;
if you pray for the dead , you do this with the hands that you &apos;re going to get to the sky with the sky that you &apos;re going to get out of spiders .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has the most powerful mother in the world that &apos;s created the mountains and the plant has created the land that you call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique , unique species of human imagination .
this material that you all know is a little bit more powerful , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i shut up there , they fit in , because in a hundred years , my body can come back without a framework .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world and don &apos;t have to take care of the world &apos;s or the search of it , because you have many alternatives .
first , you start atoms in a special bottle .
i started a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is agricultural dollars in debt .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot more powerful than all the speakers i &apos;ve been going to come to .
and she thought about my work of mathematical models , which is to promote a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- it &apos;s a deep , cultural issue , and you find it for boring -- and find another pattern of interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about it in two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a series of head and number .
back to more secular , it &apos;s because of that you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only in one percent is wrong .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take death to a sudden that &apos;s a sudden death that &apos;s going to stay for another . &quot;
not as improbable as one in 73 million , but pretty unlikely .
the quality quality of quality that has the amount of impact on the industrial process is carried by statistics .
the most important thing is that hundreds of thousands of lives have saved , the world .
a smart power force prevents injury because the electricity is always made up until an intelligent strain of evolution .
but , on the other hand , china is a solar program . a term from a very recent period of combat .
you have facebook , we have a lot of time .
yet , the tectonic self can create a very strong force , which had never been in history .
so , the chinese of this mountain model is the real medium , not just as simple as a mere number .
how big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , we &apos;ve got to really change through the last three years , and they did more and more transparent , because they didn &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , and more chinese , and human rights as their own predilection , rather than a century &apos;s own privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven seventh symphony was the beethoven seventh symphony .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty much be nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite of his life has been removed to try and see the death factors , why there was sound there , and his skull has been on the sides of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to go , in this sort of tin auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s a different thing .
in this crucial point in the dutch history , my father was at the bank of the river river near the street of the river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as a tool of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then knocks 250 chemicals out .
this is a very uplifting thing in the middle of the middle of the wounded war .
you can &apos;t be really careful .
i &apos;m in both very interested .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolved in the way that technology is evolving in the way .
now , evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of that interaction , evolution has basically been the technology , and the evolution of the whole thing that was the first step in technology was to produce the next step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make a good step .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the growth of growth in a year .
another big revolution is the most powerful revolution .
to go back to our exponential growth , 1,000 dollars of computing is about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we are going to get the full four of these trends , and they have to be careful how often the proverbial is made of technology -- faster and faster if we get to this point .
you can get blessing and peril .
they &apos;re harder .
they were out of the street .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not like there .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that is linked to the metal .
and we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , and they &apos;re a breathing in the african plain .
the 11th september has a computer disorder . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own dna , and we have a product product .
i was not as good as he did , but we managed to do it , and we had a , tracy chapman , tracy chapman and bruce chapman and bruce , on a computer for self-expression , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; well , the truth &quot; and let us get .
musicians and activist peter gabriel reveals his personal motivation with the human rights of human rights , and telling stories of active research projects .
next , we asked ourselves , how do you do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing how to deal with it , and the dance is his favorite , which allows him to get to the very pressing .
the beetle climb a lot less rare on the pill when she put up , when she &apos;s wearing no one .
here &apos;s our main experimenter .
we &apos;re playing a video game and we see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
so , the argument that it makes fun to fall into these big adventures , right , not quite with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a ride next year to antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation , the vc &apos;s brainwaves , is that they &apos;re the entrepreneurs that they &apos;re investing in and they &apos;re going to make a lot of money with it .
and next to the experience , a company to lead or lead something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially government service in which there were no problems .
from there , they take them -- on a solid , good path to the top . right from the beginning to the end .
if i happen to know somebody who &apos;s made this device like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick test of time .
even if the competition is working on old patterns ...
it &apos;s hopefully all positive , positive , positive , positive .
if you follow my suggestion , you &apos;ll have a very large presentation , very much , very , very much , to get to the head of who you are , who are to bring them to emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you make something imitating , you might have an effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , the last place that innovation doesn &apos;t value .
as we think and behave , our business system is broken .
we have a superstar meme -- seriously to be .
but forgive me , the problems today aren &apos;t the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest most popular ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
by a drastic change , change , like transparency , change , like the design of life , and collaboration , collaboration , and not the other thing that &apos;s focused on outcomes , and not the things that are focused on results .
because only the challenge is that the only way that the things that are going to be made for us is to get rid of the one that &apos;s the old little bit of the old hut , and find new creative solutions for the problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the computer is called , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the head of the day , because the most popular thing was that .
after i had a gesture of the track of the head , they were very -- i was accepted and i was working there for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know , all of the stuff .
my kids , the baby , and henry .
we &apos;re going to put a lot of magazines , we did our homework , but where we were looking at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds , after the baby turned to the arms , and i brought it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t speak about his subscribers -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better than i was born in the wonders of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to lose control of the control of a wonderful way , what we &apos;re doing , our lives , very much sense , and what &apos;s extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a very consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this star &apos;s &quot; star &quot; with the &quot; star . &quot;
imagine , you know , to hear great , late , late , as you would play personally , and john mandelbrot &apos;s walker &apos;s walker shows how photographs can be analyzed on the exact surface and then analyzed them on the top of the wing .
now , since we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest ski in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as well politicians might always be in , &quot; in the ecstasy apple to bite without the mine , &quot; the &quot; way somebody put it , you can &apos;t hide , you can &apos;t hide . &quot;
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a little chaotic man , which was fed from tomato soup , and iron for completely pisa .
but interestingly , this also tastes a future where society is a few tricks of capitalism , which is how to wipe the dna apart the dna , by trying to do things , and then the ones who work , and they &apos;re working , and they &apos;re working
i want to show you a fascinating new new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights i &apos;ve been working on , which i &apos;ve been working on , the relationship between the structure of language that you &apos;re talking about , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to speak right , it &apos;s going to be the way that i &apos;m going to do it , constantly thinking about it .
well , this is a very big theory .
please press this device so that you can adjust with your dominant hand , so i can measure your favorite .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability is to communicate about generations .
we english teachers are constantly .
but i &apos;m about using them as a census .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
and at the same time , i was on the field of the field of the day , although i &apos;m a ph.d. in a layered curriculum .
people and the humanities and the humanities and the birds and everything that goes up is the red line here . these are people , livestock and pets .
we &apos;re focused on serious energy problems of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
it flew last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just goes , and you can see every time you want to .
and he was amazed by how people were practiced the buddhist religion in india .
and he goes back as a broken man back to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re going to take a lot of us . we take the feeling of memory and a long time in the living of this meditation .
and you think about how the things are the things that are happy if they &apos;re happy , if they &apos;re happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and more vulnerable to others .
although the change in your attitude is something for other creatures , they feel these new quality of the quality , and it &apos;s helping them , and it &apos;s going to help them , and it &apos;s been a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with the handle , is using a society to get the public health to the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two ^ yemeni .
and i don &apos;t want to stop it with detail , but in the bottom right corner , you see an example of what we have for this .
did you start to do that ?
and this is what the most important thing comes from , the things jimmy had spoken , what jimmy had , what our new kind of organization is , or better say , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be able to be able to get it in the use of the way that it &apos;s in collaboration with the water industry .
so , for example , we have astronomy , which yochai had mentioned .
there will also be more professional arguments , professional arguments .
so , there will be no argument about two camps , but there &apos;s a lot of interesting positions that are going to be taken from people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to dedicate their attention to somebody , and actually , a team it did , and then they did it between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for this .
but the truth is that life is right here .
so the people on the face of this , they &apos;re calling like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to be dressed to my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t make a story , so that it turned out that she was just moving into another city and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , from genes , dopamine and mutual , and to the process of the brain , until the most of the time .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases , because there was no violence under her ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other as you can be .
and by the way , i have an email today , where we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force , perhaps the least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why atomic nuclei are together , you should basically , with a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that you now have -- that you have now ...
the comparison is that people in this room are in this room .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory , the physical compass seem to be able to unite the big bang , and a perfectly wonderful prediction . the model didn &apos;t make it happen , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light , and it allows the civilization to see the civilization from all .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the world &apos;s book , from the 1950s , looking at the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use fmri to measure the silver imaging system , and after they had the face of polarization in the face of the frontal collider .
&quot; because the colors that they have , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? got more policemen in the place ? &quot;
we built the light , the people who were people who were paying people from the people who were going to be in the foreign war , and they were going to be in abroad when they &apos;re going to be able to cover their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it for half . &quot;
all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came out and offered to stations for mobile phones .
a graph for the transformative power of technology is going to be in kibera .
until 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones in the world .
in the stores of the environment , the batteries and the batteries and bread were used .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a brain , in the endless , the endless , the rose .
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and then , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i was going to be a kid on his head to be a kid , not to slide from his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen all the time as creative technology can be and in our lives , we can do those solutions , innovation and moments , which is not the flow of time , but again , making it back .
my mother was a poor .
in every single refugee camp , they had to tear soldiers to my older brother mark , who was nine , taking a child child soldiers .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want to have , from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in full-time , because i don &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
so almost all life on earth is going to be about five five times .
svante libeskind : the answer .
why should this be a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the rotors turn with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does that as it &apos;s obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this shows that we double the most sophisticated , 30 times , four , four , more 100 , where we can get them to form teams , how they can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much , and i want to expand your horizon here , which is consciousness , and your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , which is basically the most important , which is the most powerful , many different viruses , bacteria and the food system .
they don &apos;t experience that .
and the cooks take their own dishes , and the honey -- there are a lot of the logic -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when you stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have it , especially in the last decade , to recycle the world with a dense chain of the landscape of global trade , with a chain global trade .
and never before were so many people in this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not a european invention .
and the meat meat in the u.k. and china is driving up the mountain .
agriculture has been most of the people , and here are not a lot of farmers under them , to be bad , to be the environment , to be able to destroy the environment .
all right .
and as i do here , my bread is doing -- and i have it , and i &apos;m trying to burn my hands .
and also , to keep the long time to keep up the land there , with the tools that are available and to repair materials .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , and i try and analyze a new technology , and it &apos;s determined to create a new technology , and it &apos;s determined by quantitative .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this from here , a new connection with nature .
that was a couple of days ago in northern africa .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but , in fact , the fictional oysters was one of them , and shekhar kapur turned a film over her , and he would see her .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is what we have in a process of a constructive act .
this is a patient &apos;s patient that was then 73 -- he really needed a bypass , but he was interested in this .
i like this slide because you &apos;re going to talk about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high toilet meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a very important thing . americans eat more fat because even more , and even more , the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most profound studies that were found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of the people had bad breath , 54 percent of the headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is what intimacy is , the water &apos;s .
i hope he doesn &apos;t stay in .
the film is based on a wooden scan of f.
two main projects were involved in the project , warner brothers and the computer brothers .
and we had a lot of passion to make the difference and technology .
we &apos;re so mentioning by motion capture .
the number of things seemed to be infinitely .
and that &apos;s the data that we get from that , and then we &apos;re using it for the model .
and so the finished picture was used in the movie .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka .
and it has a personal experience .
people of temptation will be overcome these cruel , more sophisticated years where they lived their lives long .
we were too fourth -- two car phones as a driver -- and imagine that this vast one is a sea from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is best , the best mantis animal on the world . &quot;
and they use it as much as we see our online culture .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i &apos;m not going to go through my body temperature until my body temperature goes down 40 degrees , enough to borrow an egg .
so , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . that &apos;s what a idea .
but how would you like to say , if you never knew how to do the next day , whether you &apos;re going to be a living god , the world in the clouds , or whether you sit down there from the wallpaper , or you &apos;re sitting down
who could sleep in this night ?
but did you know that judy was going to be a movie in your age 150,000 dollars a film that was the french army , and did the french pascal have been cleaned up the french army -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and a load of hand .
and the human race is more than that , but you would take these two columns out , probably not much more .
and also , we have the problem in elephants that you can &apos;t build construction , which would be too heavy for a single elephant .
one component of this is understanding . here &apos;s a kind of a the way that the ability to understand the other and to share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test doesn &apos;t get good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely mad , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent , i &apos;ve been able to do pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing to do .
and i have to say , god is thanks .
so i heard , in a way , in a way .
over the years , the serious business problem can be made .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life was getting me
and i think many scientists share this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were repeated , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not going to be told .
... a priest ?
finally , one group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in today &apos;s life .

if we think of marine marine animals like dolphins , we have to be over the consequences of our interventions , the very very good ones we thought we &apos;re very badly about .
after the world &apos;s computer , the marine marine industries made these systems available to the world to experience what the scientists could hear .
they &apos;re just hearing the low frequencies .
and when males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , they &apos;re going to imagine what the impact of the world &apos;s population would have been pregnant .

this is something we can work on in our lifetimes , i thought i could make a difference and i tried to get out of the street , in the field of the street .
but sometimes science has some other properties that really make you really interesting .
what do we bring more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so , intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we &apos;re not looking at alligator as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most sophisticated part of the world &apos;s name with the name of the name of the neocortex , the nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer memory . not in the least like a computer memory .

it &apos;s real .
it has done english to learn and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and that &apos;s a three participants .
if you think , you know , unlike the employer of the united states , that was actually part of our experiment , because we did that .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we put a delay one between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the time .
the price for this is the subsidies from paradise .

lexicography : the process dictionaries build .
well , i &apos;ll give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- you see , if someone thinks about a place and then you don &apos;t find it on the map , then he says , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;

i &apos;ve got the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary .
so i get a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i &apos;ve gone here .
and so , piece of play , while this three days , you start understanding , why am i listening to all this stuff that i &apos;m doing ?
they may be from a ted speaker and we can get the conversation while the year , and next year , coming back to the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers didn &apos;t turn the most sophisticated material in their cheap water , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with as a very severe byproduct that could actually fold on the palm .
there was a insecure , whether that was already encrypted , and it was technically not able to find the sequence .
instead of dreaming , you &apos;re going to make it a sense of the way that you can do it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves an industrial &amp; amp ; es and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is a cartoon of a human being .
we debate about the case &quot; what the world needs now , is nuclear , &quot; right ?
and now , there &apos;s only three main pieces of time -- coal and gas , water , which is almost everywhere -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian european region by turning it into electricity .
and the wind emissions are more equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming , and transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the prevalence of nuclear power is because we know that india and pakistan are born nuclear weapons in the field of plastic .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most important thing is that the water is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are needed to create global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables .
i was worried about the 10 years of course .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was got by apollo jennings .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that allow us to explore space is going to allow us to get into space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition , and they were in the competition , and they were between one million dollars .
and we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsors is the sum of the world &apos;s population and the social economy .
would you surprise us , so i &apos;m fascinated with it ?
that means that space can cut itself . you can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time , because we had just seen the outside , was that the surfaces continue to continue to go back , within the column , that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division of cell division , michael mcchrystal writes algorithms that create incredible , intriguing forms of millions of surfaces . no human being could make it revolutionize , but you can help revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of forms here for you here .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that has been developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip mimics even the most sophisticated .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s run by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position i &apos;m .
so i think women in our society are going to be leaders because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that more people have been using resources as well as youtube and social networks to give their stories expression , to show their photos and their own voices with their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to go to the place , and to explore our part of the world .
so i got more or less than &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants a few apartments , they pull it out there . &quot;
this was called a hoop house .
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks , can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i &apos;m turning it around , and it shaped the car .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very , very powerful work , but the best things come in small bits of glass .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they did the job , they can do more dimensions .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute carbon , awareness of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary properties of divinity .
my favorite body flew into the one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all of the walks of the middle , which i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , which i might not be shy of , who i would not be shy of , the friends i wouldn &apos;t look at , the friends that i could not go
because you don &apos;t need the most sophisticated thing .
and if you &apos;re going to get you from back to the bottom , you can just go down to the wind , you can just go down and make it a little bit of it . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors cut my leg off , and i hoped there was a 15 percent chance of chance .
as i was more humane , and in this moment , i was probably 14 kilos of the time i am now .
and nobody is looking at this modern health system in my eyes more than david black .
and to walk upright , you say , the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of international union for the most of the world &apos;s most popular name , which is the least the name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic video of him .
so once i tried to get the piano to get me to close the piano , i became a lot of plastic .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the &quot; flight &quot; wasn &apos;t a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger slippers . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to do that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that &apos;s still not contaminated , in a world that &apos;s not covered yet .
so we know that you can be able to do that , that the research has been given to absolutely impossible than i started .
the long pleasure is to support the mother , which is the long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep the whole life , and that can be the whole life to be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the forest in the forest needs meat , and so the pygmies that are burning in congo , the congo palms that have been burning in congo and have lived in their wonderful lifestyle so many years .
yesterday , somebody said that .
we &apos;re now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the ones in new york .
do you get me to go down here and turn me down here ?
out there , the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- so a radical reduction of complexity , but yet the trial is to create something more powerful .
it &apos;s actually very , very noisy . if you &apos;re in action , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you all are experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game .
we then see the self-assembly of these bodies from oil oil , which we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs represent this black mud -- this diverse , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin viii , &quot; protocells , &quot; and the experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could come on the earth first ... and maybe elsewhere .
this is a video project to walk your tadpole on the evening .
what is that -- where did you know ? they took it .
but if we do that at each fire -- every fire fire , we could redefine the emergency of an emergency .
it &apos;s the trash that &apos;s going to fix the way that you &apos;re going to fix it in pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s being connected to -- it &apos;s being connected .
the birds could jump from one to another jump .
you can get a lot of news from him . you can talk to him .
but to keep this herd , a big tribute to our planet is going to be .
next capture , we multiply the skin cells and multiply them in a wooden scanner .
we &apos;ve been working on thousands of years of the products , in products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing our research in our research , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after that , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , to create energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , that can also be other .
you had to survive .
and we certainly put our school class to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive away from their remaining place ?
it became a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the design system that has been soon a big , liberal of brazil .
when i was a time , my favorite , i started to start the study of the world &apos;s field , i studied this research field .
if you put in the south of the manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the ones that are protected places .
or the most profound , the wet meadows , the wet meadows needs insects and the places .
maybe a more successful one was living there .
it &apos;s so much power in it , science and visualization to connect that these images are coming up with these images . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of magnitude in our society now .
so i have to go to this .
you can do the pristine thing , of course , to be the pristine thing .
this is a building building .
one example that we all know is this one cell cell , right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirect way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of them that help us create it .
seriously , clap , you &apos;re quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex steffen sees a sustainable future
you could be that this might be a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to let it too much .
but if you make a lot of money high copies , and you sell it , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found , and each one of the choices that we &apos;ve found is the absence of horror in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very supportive , expensive education , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken .
and i thought i &apos;d start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional one is somebody who &apos;s a combination of competence , confidence and beliefs .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us , what is possible . what do you do ?
the entire power comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re going to be careful , is what you should do , if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re being arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re a animal .
it &apos;s going to be the tension in there , reducing the presence of the schools , and it &apos;s going to be between teachers and parents , so the puppets can call the teachers and the parents , and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a more nuanced .
and our main process is creating one of the largest , dynamic , dynamically , dynamically , different computers of the world .
you see the most sophisticated line along the ground of the world &apos;s surface , which is what we &apos;ve been doing as an artist for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there are data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to go physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and in almost every other way , &quot; i don &apos;t have any minute . &quot;
he didn &apos;t hire him , and of course , ray was going to be the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;ve been using to tell you about , and i &apos;ve been using a series of images of the images .
we collected our materials , went from the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were making two pictures and they had two beautiful , very big , great pressures of the great things for you , and we said , &quot; what would you give them ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive , and say , &quot; you know , we give a nuclear prize and we can do it on two different ways .
and the big car , the big car and the most powerful , is beautiful .
voices : it flies into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds of the clouds , but further back into a time before we put stories on the surface of the water , or the water on the wet river .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of the roof of the roof , you know .
and so we had my father , because i knew he would kill me , if i had to go alone , so we go up to the car .
&quot; and had this guy about a blue uniform and a more mature expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to go in there ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread , i &apos;m not sure of the -- more metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come out again .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret model .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little , old lady , damn still . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really have a lot of fear .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and with who together ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we &apos;re driving , where we live , where we live and work .
smart skilled on the station communicate and you see exactly where your bus is on the road and when it comes , and you can buy your own tickets in real time .
i want to think that we &apos;re going to be able to make the wireless world , and i urge that this network to open up standards for each other .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who have a mental illness in touch , knowing what a challenge can be .
i said that i wanted to tell the most of the time i wanted to share with you the three of this fantastic sharing and i wanted to leave it with a hook .
because they were all about three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a genuine person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is about .
i ate the little little baby . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many , that &apos;s got to see the problem .
i found it weird about making it a competition , as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s a little white , rich , rich , rich , which was not suggesting for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a very simple thing .
people were making it over two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the design of the new york , which i found very moving .
because at the point of view , the four platforms along the sky -- where one is more productive version of a nuclear ball -- we knew that it had to be mobile , and the way that the policy of ground zero is going to respond to the ground
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a privilege .
and i know kids have practiced every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , would be a little bit of the board of a few hours of mine , and most of us have completely cracked in a period of a few hours to some weeks .
you have to know about the problems we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom saw a helmet that was a helmet for 20 dollars to keep a $ 100,000 way to keep a 100,000 .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the davos in 2005 , when his doodles were in 2005 , and he was described by the way , and he was described by this .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s happening in the series of sequence .
he was told that there were no cure .
today , all countries are compelled to offer patents for drugs that have at least 20 years .
it depends on the corporate company , to the drug companies , to make their patents available and to make them available to others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a more powerful , the people sat in the jumping sun , the afternoon , very high humidity , and they felt not comfortable .
you can adjust everything to worry for your well-being .
he offers all these services , expanding , breeding , tickets , and so little things you &apos;re doing online , but for people who are so only connected to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the husband of daughter , he was also sick by the manuscripts of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , the first thing that had a research program had a research program .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking a different structural position inside the network .
that &apos;s my favorite . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet one of both of them in the world have been placed in a particular way , on the left , and they get the light , which is soft and dark .
so to put something out of something , let me just push a little bit out of it .
and then , after all , it &apos;s not easy to be .
under the same circumstances , older men are holding their cognitive resources , like the brain , and memory , more of positive information than on negative .
we cost life .
they &apos;d like to take me , &quot; tonight , i &apos;ll perform this one of these little girl &apos;s sessions on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i &apos;m , frankly , not quite , often , which happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve been calling me brother and uncles , and i kept invited to get over a period of five years .
hillel : the second treaty of fort laramie &apos;s fort laramie laramie , the most important of the sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie was expected to sign at least three quarter of the world &apos;s book to have land .
they were tired of the treaties .
the most popular is eight times as high as the american average .
so what is going on ?
and today ? the child mortality came down by 1960 from 24 percent to six percent .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe , and you have to take it every day to regulate the blood sugar .
if we do , you have to do with people ...
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
is it : are you smarter than a more powerful ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is this car , and this is a car .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i &apos;ll use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect these with a scientific method .
this is something else to do as a effective campaign .
what &apos;s not new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the sun to be in the sun .
now , logic -- logical , logical , you &apos;re now looking at this position in this position -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be able to address . if you &apos;re now ... another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in that , i &apos;m going to present some of the things that i &apos;m going to do .
here -- i have to look at the beginning of looking at my cards as i can follow -- oh , we should have started together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what map is i supposed to use ? the queen or five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait , wait -- take some card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
lg : yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- are all the maps synchronized -- are all the cards covered -- is you all right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly -- five seconds .
some of you seem to know this kid .
after i was back to a computer i was doing my whole company . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a musical language , you could not turn down a car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i say my students always : &quot; if you get a fallacy always , you can see every time you get a fallacy . &quot;
imagine the person , and they follow the whole way of the b to e and they &apos;ll hear everything chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years , and i had a realization for 20 years .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , this middle-class strip , not working -- often doesn &apos;t work and often work .
think of your own work .
the standard standard is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new operating system for our businesses .
this one day a little bit more intense autonomy has led to a whole range of light that might never have been given .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its light weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , they &apos;re flooded with interconnected , every sphere and their distances , and the distances are reduced to this little earth .
and the blue side , the most profound , shows the other direction .
this has evolved with a lot of the years in many of the brain projects .
the main thing on the object would be a high picture of the earth .
but it &apos;s always going to go back to the 10 percent or more , which is most manageable or more .
and the one day , and a group of research , the u.s. &apos;s company .
nonprofit organizations have to join themselves , bold , big activism , new beliefs , trying to be a fear of fear that are being pulled through the dirt .
so what should they do ?
the overhead went on .
dan blakley : our mindset about charity is a
then there was the most profound listeners , yes , that &apos;s the way you have the music of the music .
people who made these kinds of things that have been doing the most beautiful instruments , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about execution of music , as you wrote , not to interpretation . &quot;
this is great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is available when you needed it . that &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a result , we tell ourselves many stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 countries worldwide in the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really really doable .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
you think it &apos;s going to move on to whether you &apos;re going to move it further .
and the most important thing said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition , we would have to invent all of the entire community growth for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain degree of the same , the games that they play to play this is so much that you can &apos;t see what &apos;s actually quite obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states , which are not going to be the big challenge to these big challenges .
and even if you just get up , you could get funding there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a sense of understanding when i went to visit , and i was in a computer shop in my life , and i tried to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady i knew was that sex may be so good for the five senses .
and according to the good sex , all five senses on a extreme level .
of course , the five senses is not the only thing that life makes a difference .
we &apos;re all born as artists .
if you have a conversation that &apos;s going to have to come up with the next answer to the next answer , the child has to come up with what it has started .
but your parents tell them , &quot; it &apos;s going to wash all of the waves . &quot;
but kids normally make art from fun . it &apos;s play .
but that &apos;s how a teacher is rarely found .
in the blink of the world , people who are born , the &quot; hotel of california &quot; or &quot; hotel california &quot; as they mimic them .
right in this minute , we can turn off the tv , and it &apos;s the way that they &apos;re out of the internet , they stand up and they start to do something .
the students fall into a kind of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i said , &quot; actors , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with how i came to this point .
there will be stronger storms and larger flooding .
if you know , there &apos;s a global warming in the future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
the economic consequences are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if a car accident happens , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t only make the stunt men , but the crew .
so , for something else , they used to be used to the other thing , once that was all you had .
but today we use a nuclear test .
it &apos;s not , a more powerful thing .
in 1960 , joseph ornish &apos;s united states has done something very incredible .
one of the difficulty in this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 years , you can really use oxygen .
and they designed a puppet to him , and he looked at it .
we expect and we expect others to say maybe the lesters or the most important thing will say , &quot; you must put somebody in a suit that &apos;s not attached to the airplane . &quot;
there were three main classes -- right ? -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing by the conference that i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; you know it . &quot;
the problem is to stay an artist while you grow up . i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow in creativity , but we &apos;re going to be in the way that we &apos;re going to be in the world .
all over the world .
the whole system was invented -- all over the world , there was no public education systems in the 19th century .
the brain is not divided in areas .
they made ballet , they made a lot of music , jazz , they danced modern and contemporary dances .
the festival goes to the way very well . with a press press for you to die .
let &apos;s just value for the value of the game .
in dubai , for me , like a hand , it &apos;s like a hand that wants to bring things to the gang .
before i want to return in the middle east , i want to close as a stimulus with a quote of one of the largest most exciting .
it &apos;s also the most popular thing .
well , you &apos;re all of the behaviors of behavior , and you &apos;re disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools will be that or what we need to do in the most closely , to be able to get able to get the different behavior .
how are you going to expand it ? &quot;
the three are the same , although they &apos;re all the same in different context , one is magical , the other two , like work , i like this books , because they have something very special about themselves .
the kids have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the content is important .
i was changed by my children .
howard makes this experiment and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beautiful shark force makes it .
this was his somali . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there are all these .
and the people say , if you ask them , how do you want to wish their coffee .
mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so , why did it . why did we like that ?
he was a few hugs and spent the most of his career in lower school , and then he ended up in management . he was the general manager of the oakland &apos;s manager .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given to symptoms of the world &apos;s rights , until we have a huge study , driven by the national security user , found , found , found , found , found , found , found , found , found
thank you .
but dad was terrified , and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a deep region in between .
these are four really different types of species to see the world . i named it .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you &apos;re going to see it -- and -- by the way -- that &apos;s from buenos ladenism -- all the artifacts of modern comics : the whole artifacts of modern comics : the very simple line of light and a family on the
and that was what i proposed : we could maybe make comics on an infinite canvas : on the bottom and on the y-axis and in the y-axis .
this is from daniel &apos;s newspaper &apos;s in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve all been aware of that , but for me , i &apos;ve been so often in this hard piece of time , i had never seen this problem that was the most profound part of the day .
this is honestly and real , and the reason that the new union &apos;s representation of this is a sustainable sense of the design .
if you believe your baby is gay or lesbian , you should get out of the adoption .
and the political solution was to pray to the citizens of texas , to the rain .
this song is called &quot; the sun &apos;s sun . &quot;
i want to start with a little different tonight , because i want to ask you to leave the mainland and jump into the open sea .
they were starting to go from the hole , 65 million years ago , when whales had legs , and they were going to have a laser test of a steel system , they allow me to get these poetic steel bags .
and how do you do that ?
the california &apos;s police is taking the molas , if you come into the bay , you tear them , they turn them into a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of
i &apos;ll show you our last data data .
and in the most exciting , that all of your love and her interest for the oceans were in common .
as you can see here , this is a high-speed circuit board .
this is not something you hear every day .
rs .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the native aboriginal , sitting in jail .
she told him it and he asked the first to the first school of what we call the most popular .
because none of them get a test .
so why don &apos;t we have something to do with this problem in life ?
goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last track ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could handle the script with the script .
von neumann , a a writer and a mathematician , brought everything together , and then they needed a room to build them .
the ones that worked first is a very common job .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally , they found that it was a very big job .
i know if i have to get beaten . &quot;
he &apos;d run the machine night , and if somebody &apos;s remembered by stephen wolfram , who was invented the whole thing .
now we &apos;re going to sit in 50 years later -- it &apos;s a kind of power of legislation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans are now alive , dying , because their diet .
this is a global problem .
it was a city .
and he &apos;s got the appeal of it . he &apos;s tired of his friends , his family and his community to have to be abused .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know that it &apos;s remained a long way for long to this close understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our kids .
and most of the kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in all of america , a lot of wonderful things go when we just look back at the time .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political energy funding that 2011 is funded by 2011 .
the net connects everything and will be very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous is using its most sophisticated information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he went in 2003 and 2004 , and he went to tour 10,000 dollars from the atm machines here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machines there using credit cards .
he was born in a stable and respect family family , and his obsession with play as a teenager led him to the most of the time .
and most of the script , and the other , with the script , didn &apos;t show real social skills in the outside world -- only in the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into detail , but some people mention .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market , and what is driving the market is mostly -- number one is the great demographic , demographic .
we &apos;ve found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be extended through the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped inspire that eight of 13 regional fires have plans in front of the brain , to become an electrical identity .
the stream exploded by the parking space .
their citizens are different than typical , but they &apos;re less than a city .
&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole kind of a whole problem . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender that is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a key , and the way it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies , that have created a disorder , that they have a lot of the challenge that they make , which is
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s very strong with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my own south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s hungary , and once from a future as independent land .
well , maybe he was too damn naive , because he stayed where he was , a long time after the nazis , and even after the most popular and the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the most powerful thing in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if they &apos;re good enough i &apos;ll be a . &quot;
and it &apos;s also clear to us , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie . &quot;
and as i said , he was too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re going to take care of the most difficult and the other day , and we &apos;re going to take the other day back .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went , while the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s going to push it so long until you go on .
what i want to try to do with this -- i hope to show you the following dots .
and what i &apos;d like to point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states is under the ocean .
it &apos;s there , because photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the sun &apos;s largest mile , the rift valley is on the top of the sun .
and so we drove along the mountain floor in a field next to the mountain , and found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new computer model , with a design of a computer , which is replaced with me , and i don &apos;t have to go up in my car .
we find the state of conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , and it &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would give a child without driver &apos;s tax card .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard .
when we saw the effect of the help , andrew and i decided that we had to scale it up to the best of the best education .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video will be interrupted every few minutes , and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask questions which are the most prolific , and how to help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either through a personalized curriculum or by a personalized curriculum that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mostly about being able to make the reality of others .
i have my concern about the values of ethiopia science , like , for example , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a business scanner .
so you can understand my surprise , when i got reading in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of the federal cord , said , &quot; jurassic rand is his favorite mentor . &quot;
i think you can do this funny , and you can &apos;t have the ones that don &apos;t have , and that &apos;s not what i have . right from this reason , i don &apos;t know about parainfluenza-4 , and his parting record .
i &apos;m going to get this old time of the ted &apos;s day , i &apos;m going to tell you .
he said , i need to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years to get a really good job of happiness .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that active someone doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve thought about the emperor of the word , thinking about beauty that she was going yesterday , and he said , &quot; in his book , that clay can sometimes make beauty . &quot;
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom is also , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would have come on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly doing that , and it &apos;s going to be a framework of a particle accelerator , and it could cause an effect that the world is destroyed .
we need to let with biotechnology the same kind of rigorous arts as we have in the same way .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst thing is .
we use a lot of money on it , we &apos;re not going to make sure that we don &apos;t die at a single time , but we don &apos;t get anything like that , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught in the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to happen .
this is very , very important because this is the system , the gothic , from the life that came from life , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we only know about it .
and this is what the system sends , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , represented in these circles .
everybody who comes up to the board is just going to get the database and can use the information that &apos;s needed for everything .
we &apos;re to ride the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of this new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most beautiful john hunter &apos;s network creates a network of the cameras , and sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive laboratory -- and it causes a nuclear impact about the world of the deep .
so i think optimism is going forward to the architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the most common thing . you know too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i rather play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes rather than repeat the same thing , so it &apos;s from its insignificance debut .
risks that were never so much known as they should be in a very challenging city .
there are the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind is building a very big ideas . he calls 17 terms of the vision of architecture -- raw , enlightened , respectful , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest most of the car of these size .
so , does something really look like , or will it just give a few more of them ?
em : that &apos;s just what you have to do . if not , we &apos;re in big difficulties .
with this capital , and then he buys the panels , and then they put the panels on the roof and then calculate the firing , or they calculate a monthly commercial plant that is lower than the air drive .
we &apos;ve been almost failed , but we &apos;ve come in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about all the world in the world , a person is literally in innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you look at our livestock , and you see a cheetahs , it &apos;s a very nervous , it &apos;s very nervous . then you go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single country , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so , until now , we were with support of the world wildlife fund , which is very small programs to get together with a little bit of programs .
also , very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment , and hiv .
and so , in fact , the most powerful , a lot of a time in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind huge winning .
dan forbid and alice mcchrystal &apos;s lead to passionate revolution for environmental food .
and the abalone shell , pots , oysters , the head , the head of music , the most famous , the most famous species .
this is like a nozzle of protein .
science looks the world through the mind , and i &apos;m looking at things that can be measured and described , but they have the art of knowledge and knowledge .
from a few cameras , a plan was a plan with 25 of these two cameras .
this is the natural cycle .
that would not be a photographer , and it would do a photograph of the way that you can do it , right ? but sometimes it has to be , and sometimes it has to be to represent the dimensions .
and here &apos;s how the glacier pulls back .
this is several cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it &apos;s to a global center for the internet center and the internet center ?
when we asked people to talk about these people in these online games , what they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be professor if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , the doctors , would go to cancer care , and at births , the heart of disease , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial design , consciously , to be 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently , a long time of life for four in the morning .
i said , i know a very keen message when i see a very somber message .
everyone in our society comes with cancer in touch -- if not personal , then a beloved man , a family member , a friend .
in this space space , the genetic material is the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we used tumor treating fields in the lab at 20 different cancers , and we see this effect at all .
he got the most salient .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s responding to the tumor , and it starts to start .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new paycheck , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it &apos;s going to be like this .
somewhere is a stream or a laser camera through this scene .
this is called &quot; mavericks . &quot; in english , we have a lot of water and underwater .
and they have to go further .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and the only time , for 27 percent , they dropped to 60 percent , 60 fewer people per year .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles , which people get from the most of the time and bring them towards the way to the industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , you see the most popular thing , and basically , every country has a kind of a , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more , a single of the two .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t grow up as well .
buy african products .
but i think a lot more problem with this is that this logic -- that we should throw ipods and not to drop out of bombs -- i mean , it would make a great title for thomas francisco .
so , 500 people would have been expected and four of them were chosen to visit the institution and so they were to be able to do it to be able to do it .
so now , citizens with design to do this is not necessarily anything that change to do this , because it still is the dictators , which control the agenda .
so , the internet &apos;s worth of energy : is the internet going to be fair expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was with us younger guys .
because for me , the time in this period , and in this particular period of life , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you want to do it ?
i was paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the more powerful , i &apos;m pretty much about the most sophisticated , which is our country , concerned , all the talk about india as a new superpower , yes , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of things tell us about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to the daylight or not .
but the lightning flash in our country was pretty slow to get a pretty slow , and it took about half an hour to a call .
you can &apos;t understand the dialogue .
this can sometimes have obsolete consequences . ok .
and these of you who have their money , they may be surprised to see how many of the people who are in the front of the world &apos;s face are explaining the water .
i went home and i did a little bit of research , and i found some terrifying statistics .
so , the big one is a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would have , mom , nature , how about all the world , is that we &apos;re going to get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i &apos;ve got it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going to do .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of water , but they &apos;re not there in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely thing is probably a lot of reasons why we want to engage new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should look like this .
bob mckim has a different very -- a different version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that , you know , you get a much better carol , much more creative results , if all of you have the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll go back to it .
you know how it feels like all of these uncertainty , as long as you left the corridor back in the corridor while the doctors are going to take care of a single case and ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel secure and have a good time because we agree about the rules and i would agree with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then when we get there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied , and we &apos;re just going to hear all the things that we did , and we just hear what &apos;s successful to us .
i was faster , but i was so depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the most important thing is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he &apos;s sure that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second is that people are actually quite aware of a connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us to determine the state of our own , our selves , but it also requires to help us .
it means we &apos;re achieving our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are the species that i want to deal with today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use , if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun said that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to put them in the right position , they &apos;re going to be on their nose and beat .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a force to see the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the most sophisticated of the system .
a cell load cell measures forces and that &apos;s actually a cell load load with a crystal inside .
this is the most important thing -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be moving around and hit the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very , very , very energetic solution .
and tactics : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic computer scientists ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other way to do that , not even more , not even for that , that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , you see that -- he just makes me stand .
the submarine , the last year , was out there .
admittedly , the understanding of architecture as a matter of energy , is , &quot; excuse me , &quot; please apologize the obvious example -- is not the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york is built on the back of the mountain , our streets about their shells .
in these eight side islands , small levels of neurons are making small pieces of water that are practically inadequate .
so you walked around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak of outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on top of the temple temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in 1994 , oil discovered .
the other side of the area is torah , where actually osama osama bin laden , and that &apos;s a little bit of a life .
this was one of the great most popular .
this is the most popular thing . let me continue and show you the hubble model of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . this is a problem .
this is going to be part of the beginning that it &apos;s going to be about the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff is that it &apos;s going to be in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture , you don &apos;t have a lot of it to see .
this simulation was done for 1,000 processors a month , just to make this visible .
we &apos;re hoping to see a resolution that is about this image of the earth that is actually the complicated pattern of the earth .
and in the episode , we are stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re constantly doing this , even in the life .
i went into a vicious cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i couldn &apos;t keep anything more .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you &apos;re looking for intent ?
all the time , it wasn &apos;t going on on tomorrow today .
the constant is the best part of the brain , as well as a brain engineer , and there &apos;s a very mysterious animal , and it &apos;s a resilient monitor of legislation .
stalin &apos;s famine &apos;s famine was killing the &apos; s , killing the day , killed millions of dollars in the 1940s , and the &apos; 40s , they were getting the nazis , the most infected , were beaten up , and many of the women were trafficked to
that &apos;s what makes the grief . &quot;
and as a psychologist , the idea of most , that we were able to do what we &apos;ve learned in virtual world , and about our identity , we could use to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together .
human relationships are curved , chaotic and scalable .
it &apos;s called it .
because in the moment , in the moment , people are even for a few seconds , they will be trusted , scared , panic , they get to take advantage of electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have won any of the most sophisticated , which some of our graduate students had predicted , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that they had a potential to make their predictions in a way of self-worth .
maybe my father &apos;s father has read .
so i had to leave you with it , but it was pretty good , and it had to be pretty friendly .
and i thought , finally , i thought , a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time , and i &apos;m going to take a look at it .
although you lose , not fear of failure when we have given everything , because who can be more important , because , in fact , to give you the world &apos;s energy .
if i call the name , i never know for an answer .
i have enough to get more educated ?
the second challenge is cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
and only last month , it &apos;s been the technology that has been able to show us the creation of human health systems .
we can map them together and apply 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their grim properties , and then we can just print this information and print it by a more nuanced thing .
i couldn &apos;t regularly stand to school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called the rickets .
and connected to this sort of thing , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the first to wikipedia and everything between -- who showed the power of a lot of people .
third , more elastic environmental environmental environmental environmental problems .
because what you need is that the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music that she plays .
my name is joseph and a member in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i try to improve the infrastructure .
i went back to the night at night with batteries and ice .
together , anybody got notes ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s in moscow and working in full-time writing , to make this happen .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city is a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most important thing is to do the most powerful work of the city &apos;s work .
they have a lot of the data , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes , that i &apos;ve been able to give up to talk about , between two and a half people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a prison cabin , a mud drum .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal grain , you have a political activity , you have a political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same amount of dna as i did , helped me get through their committed support , to get them to get their own educated spirits in law school .
and then , usually , the most common thing was , they usually worked with a plastic camera , but by using a computer company , and he used a computer company , and he could create a machine that could read every single car .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , to the different english countries , different versions of the u.k. , the u.k. , canada , canada , canada , australia , and new zealand &apos;s new zealand &apos;s new york .
the most important time . lifespan has been doubling since of the time of the time of the five hours and it &apos;s increasing , and it &apos;s increasing with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . you want to do people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine machine is such a good news , because once the androids are taking work , we don &apos;t have to do that anymore and we have to get more educated and more and more fragmented .
the social challenges because of this inequality should be aware of the attention .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially at short , at a brief point .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a world technology , embedded into a slightly more sophisticated society , and integrated through a economy that is causing inequality to help us .
in the course of the years , i started feeling more and more sophisticated with this notion of god .
some have a lot of people who are only going to believe that we can only believe in a god that &apos;s sharing our pain .
in the second phase of technology , the wind and waves obey him .
so who is god , if not the big bang or the internet ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the inside . by making my own inwardness .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the computer technology technology .
we &apos;ve never found a lot of time that was older than 40 years , and the average age of this pipeline and the collectors is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have used to be used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , which has shown einstein , and also the modern science of the world &apos;s brain , which is entropy and information and matter and energy all connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick its own plug to get more power .
and what i mean to do with that is we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that has started billions of years ago , moves through us and we have the choice , and our choice is in the technology , really , to get us to realize that power is much more powerful than we are ourselves .
and then they said , &quot; well , we have five classes to 30 students , 30 to 40 students .
we &apos;ve got all this down and found beautiful , and we found beautiful , and it had the look -- while we &apos;ve got somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat at the tables , and we waited .
there &apos;s a lot of plastic projects . the only problem for adults who have been working on mathare , who didn &apos;t really know anything about them , was that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything else is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
about 170 tutors worked with them on the book and so did this wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain there -- just behind the kids , they were taught like children .
there &apos;s also these miniature -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the field of water , but it &apos;s starting to slow down .
he &apos;s a computer &apos;s . he &apos;s bringing his cousin .
he &apos;s writing a email , he &apos;ll ask you every question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
and there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s called the manual for full idiots , did you know that ?
there &apos;s a lot of roads on cape roads , and we can drive all of this .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve been feeling bad about this .
so i saw this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good , very good .
the university is the hardest , so number 10 .
from everything strange in a strange , curious device about the window of a window , which is a window of the moment to the moment where the street was black , and the white white , white , white , was there .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with faith , but to do with behavior .
the most sophisticated thing has seen , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , down to the same size , that &apos;s about the same size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just developed countries .
we can &apos;t wait to be the most sophisticated , australia , to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the brain that we have by the assumption of this challenge .
and before i show you a few pictures to the goose , i want to point out this beautiful detail about the design of the world and design .
the rca is really an extraordinary school in this respect .
we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith &apos;s engines that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show a nice thing to show in their talks , from fear , as dumb as they are being considered to be stupid .
here &apos;s examples of that you can already print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more likely to do it , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; systematically seven &quot; &quot; s &quot; is a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; test . &quot;
the idea of justice , which is what we &apos;re doing is the limits of our own borders and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , what &apos;s just in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , it &apos;s a little bit like the most powerful thing he did in the world &apos;s office .
so every week , the most popular thing would come to the ground . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me to answer it again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , a infection , a infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- they call it the name of the muscle .
we treat them with the drugs -- the same thing that we &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get a sense of what &apos;s going on as much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . it doesn &apos;t matter . i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the line , and that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact effect , &quot; which one -- which one of them in the core of a comet is a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like me , engineers .
the difference between dinosaurs and us is that we have a design system and we can choose , and we can change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , and i &apos;ve led the only independent , the only independent medium of the country .
and i thought that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the car would be gone and a great company , if the dictator would only be gone , what was going on was that it was actually made .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;re never going to see your money , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we &apos;ll meet your business plan , which they actually did .
see , we started in latin america and in central europe , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a test .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , bonds to spend bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you organize the funding , so that there is no way there are no blind , no blind , running around to find .
so why does it work ? this is the question .
now , some call this theory of everything .
just an example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided by the square of the mountain between the one another , between the one another .
the more symmetry you have , the better you think of the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing he thought about is that most of us today , but to his time , was not granted .
it doesn &apos;t matter the importance of knowing that they &apos;re going to follow the laws of law , and accidents .
but he was reading in every free moment he had , books .
from this ambition , he went back to the computer in the back .
but when he was just doing his signature under the air industry , his hand was deaf , and he was crying , because he had a thousand hands in the morning .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the white house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what was an incredible privilege , with this aging lion of a man that was so many hours .
and like lincoln , the story was telling all of the war to the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in the back of the past .
he had the temple , and he had the temple .
this is the most dramatic thing that &apos;s the evidence that the jews are in babylon after the whole years that they were sitting in babylon , and the whole time they were going to go to babylon , and the same as the parent were going home to jerusalem
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the main cylinder is from the priests of the big bang of babylon , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people came to tehran , in iran , in iran .
some people know more about the living living market , but they think they &apos;re a necessary cruel .
the new ones , the next few hours , cried , was the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied and eventually they learned to be able to do more . within less days they were weary , they have a massage and they start to start
a study shows that support support costs 10 percent of a cost of cost , whereas it costs about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i almost spent my whole life a camera .
you know , you know what to do , you know , to find an answer .
it was people there -- most of them and family .
we heard each one .
but of course , he never came . the explanation never occurred .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this man , frederick , really one of my heroes and mentors , did it , and it was done , unicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and their possibilities , etc . -- and they were actually going to be able to get it .
we connect with the metal of the -- i met a little bit of the time , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their own business , to do their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively beneficial .
i went to the study of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big primate designer .
and amazingly , that &apos;s what our ancestors are doing about 1.5 million years ago , as they discovered cooking .
just simple approaches for the most profound conversations i &apos;ve done .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fight is the most dramatic , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to the physical rehabilitation .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were there .
i was talking to my boss in the headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting to start with a couple of hours a day , only for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s brain industry started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it going on ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we need to increase production from feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and the way that we &apos;re not just in the orthopedic center , not only in the center of people , are also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a corporate war .
and this hospital would have been able to afford to do it .
why ? because the way i had been being made is banned .
but i learned something more than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- the power of the economy of ghana -- that had made bad bad decisions that have taken our economy in short .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children and their children would care .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in swarthmore , to africa .
is my time taken ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s going to be very similar to the top yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , will not be familiar .
32 hundred , the birthplace of broadway .
it &apos;s probably a matter of happiness . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages that you &apos;re communicating ?
because , in effect , the sponsors , the sponsors , and so he gets it all over the television .
a professional school company that talks to dead , not it ?
what is homeopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have a chance of you to be able to get people to be dressed , and they agreed to be a little bit of people who were doing something .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often about a generator .
there &apos;s a better thing to do . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there &apos;s electricity or not , because you can control the most sophisticated people on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give them .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and worse device that we can provide hospitals to .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was a , like the typeface of the writing of the secret , which is the kind of secret of a secret society in the world &apos;s brain .
anyway , until 1998 , when a nuclear cartoonist named john coleman discovered in the prison of the book in the peer-reviewed , in the aftermath of the book , that was been conducted in 1800 to 1900 , centuries ago , centuries ago .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the death of the animal , and animals at the line of the line , is not just as good as the tools .
so , it was a french thing .
a picture of fish atoms would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t very bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be that maybe it wouldn &apos;t be so bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , though i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
at weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and get all the names , even though it makes a mistake .
they &apos;re distracted . he eventually wins the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too large .
you would be able to figure out , it &apos;s more interest to find out about it when the life of life is so high , but it &apos;s a very big area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
human nature would change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in honor -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it liberating to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to come to control .
so there &apos;s a little bit of time , because there &apos;s a lot of the dynamic , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that you can be more restrained .
this is a great goodbye in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and we break the individual slices , and the messenger in the hallway is going to be and we &apos;re going to be able to get it .
i was sure 20 before i went to art art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you choose to pick up the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they were interested in creating a novel alternative , alternative , alternative , and they needed money , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; bye . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most important thing -- everything you say is a little bit of the time of the world &apos;s population .
he &apos;s a computer researcher of the native aboriginal , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s with origami . so here we go .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying model of the creation .
or they go to the top and they do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules that you put circles , you &apos;re covered the amount of bubbles , and they &apos;re covered the extra rules that obey the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could have some origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a high school in the state of washington with too much more free time on the state .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about the hours of time .
and so i want to talk about that because if we don &apos;t accept it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;ll show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to interrupt the job market , and it goes on to the day .
you have instructions from the top .
because i &apos;m going to write about all this book , i still have no answer to this , and i don &apos;t have an answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
since we haven &apos;t completely transformed this information , you come back to us in the form of culture , and that strange and the other , and the other , you can see that probiotics change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who is in the middle , and it &apos;s the wires .
and the personal income on a scale that has been kept to take inflation on inflation , in this time more than doubled , is almost 1.7 .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
and so , in the last book , it &apos;s the last book of me called &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo that are very successful and very successful , with great social sense of consciousness .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very much .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own significance for what home is , they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was made of birth to them . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are also embedded in the future or present , as in the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep in .
so , the question is : where is it to home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the way , by the hell , digital technology .
the survival of the children is the new green .
and again , they were better than we were , &quot; their brits and their mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you &apos;re in people &apos;s hands , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started working with a working , and i decided to grow them , and then i worked with a team of wood -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be so good at the equator in the summer .
certainly many of the progress , many of the world &apos;s lives .
this is even real photography , at the time , that &apos;s the way that the coverage is going to be implanted within less days .
and here on the right , you see what six months later is going to be , technically appropriate .
a blood vessel is two different types of cell .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with the next solid organs , the most complex of the organs are the high , and with every amount of columbus &apos;s organs , like heart and liver and kidneys .
that &apos;s still in the business system .
we prefer cells that are not going to reject and make no tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
so i &apos;m instantly in panic -- unlike all of the kind of cerebral jellyfish and sugar that i had -- but this is really really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a nuclear record .
i went from door to door and sold bicycle plate .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do this chairs .
this is pointless . &quot; you have to get a way to get faster to money .
i sold a lot of buenos stimulators .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find other tasks and they learn to learn the ability of the brain , and they learn the ability to find more opportunities .
if you &apos;re going to go into a restaurant and make it bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad credit is .
these young , disappointments .
the development of today &apos;s students is all the interests of the world .
the most important thing about the computer of the world &apos;s or a more of a family of cultural development is pulling in the most of our students .
the values of the past will also also regulate the whole amount of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most fundamental .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is , you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , this is not a rights organization , but clear -- let me close that -- creative commons offers a simple way to make your content with the liberties that you want to leave you .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often something happens .
he told me that he was the most successful , and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be here now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run them through this process and show them how this journey looks .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i was living , just to understand it .
i &apos;m going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use this microbial ecosystem to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread through the people is based on the people , and architects like to bring together spaces of similar type of ideas to promote human interaction or exchange of ideas for example .
imagine a design , take the microbes to take care of , for example , on the plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the company , built a system called printing for apple .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most violent .
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a method that you wanted to do with that was one of these humpback whales , one of those humpback whales .
in 78 percent of the voices . to give you a notion of the ted victory : ah , two in the ted industry made only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is , you can be very successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege it is to stand today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando , are the most powerful .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to be ahead of the world &apos;s energy , to make this possible today , what science is going to do .
there &apos;s color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to end up at night .
voice : why not ? this is a very good sheet .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , and you can &apos;t run a civilization-state on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for that is , first , the state in china gets a very special -- surely a very special deal from the focal , the embodiment and the neighboring of chinese civilization , the world &apos;s embodiment .
he was in 1903 , in the middle of beijing , and shanghai was in shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the simplest -- the position of the position of the brain , which is rapidly sensitive -- or the hejaz .

i made graffiti , wrote my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image would be next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a face -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing here ? &quot;
and most of the places i went to go to , i decided to go because i heard about them in the media .
i took more photos and we started the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were watching , they were a woman , &quot; well , god can see . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind every photo .
but they basically made me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and about what it drives , why is it happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a design of a design .
they &apos;ve been able to have a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to be in participation . cities have been welcome to the most integrated of all kinds of people .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very , very powerful .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would produce a very challenging drug problem .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , the ideas that we think about , we &apos;re looking at the beginning of the beginning , and make sure that this is a particularly great century , and not one of the most powerful and a half of the brain and a
my remaining family is boring academics who are doing that , to collect the most of the food of the food system for our food .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something was really left to me .
i was sitting , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
and he has been crying in my career since netra was a lot of success .
i started exploring the most sophisticated state of human psyche .
so this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 in the last of 2006 &apos;s today . in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall fall fall .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you &apos;ve got the problem , you remember ?
sw : big final .
sw : what about a nuclear reactor ?
my parents found this important for their inner silence .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s things apart to me to be close to the other thing i &apos;ve been doing .
the body has higher density than the water is , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this is going to bring you very far .
i asked him what that means .
and then , from that point , you can imagine , if you want to pay several languages and take it without any other .
and they looked up to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s better . &quot;
i think they agree to me that they &apos;re very good in common .
and have been done with 50,000 students , and they &apos;ve been doing something like this , half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .

geoff blakley : a little introduction of the killer
and finally , the only person who &apos;s installed , a young shepherd , and he goes on saul and he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there are the cavalry , men on horses and with the plastic .
goliath is easy prey . he &apos;s not a chance .
so , goliath is bigger than the time of being a lot larger than the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for that when someone is so far outside of the norm .
and i think that &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a quantum , and these microbes are mostly doing well , rather than killing us .
they all have microbes and the eggs then used into the receiver .
most pills , or the most sophisticated , you can eat , one or two , maybe five forms , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a design system for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
very many people think about the internet , and it &apos;s very tied to english , but it &apos;s really global to us , and we &apos;re in many , many languages .
when you saw it a silly change on the side of me , they thought that it would be just in hostile , and they thought that all of them would be in rubbish .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we have over 40 to 40 , 40 , 40 .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .

it seems to me as though most textbooks , who are used to education , of our children , from biased .
in the jungle of guatemala , in the jungle , a temple is .
not a well-known indian indian in southern kenya , and it was a missionary in the year , and here it is .
it &apos;s far below your cognitive property .
we also found activity in other areas -- in brain areas that are associated with computation and loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s just playing a terrible school game .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we apply to each other , and we &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to talk . &quot;
tools like watching knives , knives , charismatic or more disabled , which i had been appointed in a towel .
i had been looking for long and wide , but never looked at my nearby .
in some of the ways they &apos;re putting tools , they &apos;re about sponges to the top of the world .
so dolphins can tickle and drag up from the distance .
look at how they synchronize their partner and the other other people .
but we found out quickly that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a keyboard at a keyboard .
this dolphin , we called &quot; aw &quot; , &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; because they were vaccinated about 12 of the years of descent .
but while we decode their natural noises , we also plan to bring this back into the computer system .
and the word is invented .

and especially if you &apos;re in the business community , you have to fly the feeling .
yr : i just try to be fit up .
i may have used this in the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t say that to your employer .
but it was up to the top of the line and full of echolocation .
wondering , the result of what you saw is to explain to explain by invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since the known of our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt it to our needs , it &apos;s going to be measurable in the growing .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your attention is based on assumptions ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a more cosmopolitan story .
and only if an explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can check it out .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re pretty abundant .
it &apos;s about 30,000 of them .
what is minto for a place ?
the new festival challenges the audience , a key role in design , to play .
she had met with other people to look at &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; and it did all the same . &quot;

i thought my career was over .
this is a bear where i sat in a little while .
this is a piece of the ice ice ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you images today from the computer , and i &apos;m going to show you the polar bears and polar bears and the polar lobes , but this image is what i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they &apos;re malignant . we knew it . &quot;

open your eyes now .
do you have a ring ?
they &apos;re focusing on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing this so long until you squeeze it .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a very large man , working up there .
as i said , it &apos;s actually shaping your reality .
we were working on it , and we &apos;re working together , and we &apos;re going to build it together .
a call in the united states , to canada or china , is five of the u.s. or china &apos;s dollars .
it &apos;s built up , so you can also join a more , you know , a more powerful way of connecting and to remote places .
and the time the buildings were higher , and more and bigger our technology always became better , so that the mechanical systems were enormous .
imagine two americans traveling together in italy .
please raise all the people who are liberal .
the best definition of the &quot; aw &quot; i know -- she &apos;s so much -- comes from the -- comes from the of the rubber gary taylor wurman .
he makes us very , very old boxes .
but look at the other three lines on the other side .
isn &apos;t that easy to be the foundation of the media and the internet and the internet ?
she went upward up and continued to go up .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the computer &apos;s rights , the liberals , is the liberals , and both work together .
and so the answer is , i think , to use these passionate commitment to truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react to a lot of other people in the environment , the ones that are innocent , but also hurt -- the military wants to talk to you about failure .
we look at something else , &quot; and realized that the situations were really comparable .
there &apos;s a commandment , how often if you think about how much the police was introduced to queensland , how often would the police express o.c. spray in queensland ?
there was only a few people shot at this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most important way to deal with it .
and if you &apos;re threatened to use them , people will give them , but they shouldn &apos;t make a memorable damage . &quot;
we started organizing makers in our &quot; maker fair . &quot;
and it &apos;s a little bit of billy bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about that , but just ...
but he also moved around here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; the &quot; bye . &quot;
and we need to bring that into schools , or in the communities , in many , many ways -- the ability to construct the world around us and shape it .
there &apos;s glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these miniature photographs of stars that all the time -- you call it a little bit of it .
they &apos;re not looking at a way of being a way of thinking about it , but you have to be mentally sensitive to the world .
stairs that are caught from a steel winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to give you the illusion that if you buy this light , you will be able to live in a world without wires .
the perfect thing -- it &apos;s the perfect chain , it &apos;s called the perfect chain , with the perfect color .
because glamour can be very appealing and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard she was working for the whole week .
i did that many of the strangers .
i heard about women who were imprisoned in their homes , or in their homes , in their own business , like dead left on parking parking rooms , burned in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was doing this big bowl and i asked her , &quot; what is this ? &quot;

please tell me that they don &apos;t have to be able to call it , if we say , the pentagon is calling that way .
but why do you have to feel something at all ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course for a course of the internet .
and second , is it possible or is it possible to slow down , slow down ?
they want to return to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six of the world &apos;s six countries and work hours of the country who would be crying in front of the average american .
but the new idea that &apos;s the revolutionary idea of the world &apos;s brain is that it &apos;s like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m finding the story of the story like a computer problem on my own ted , and it &apos;s a little bit of the time i was going to be , because they were so slow and i wanted to be done fast .
and so all his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on an island ; part of it must stay on the shore because we don &apos;t want to avert the community . &quot;
i worked at months and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum already , with information , and then they &apos;re going to see a museum that they could do , they wouldn &apos;t be able to process that anymore
when i flew home , the most popular was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .

they had to get a lot of fire around here .
in summer india , india is becoming extremely hot .
and the adult animal , which comes out , is still alive or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of years of time .
this made me a little bit curious . i &apos;m going to hear you , because i want to ask you . and here &apos;s a lot of people who have spent -- of course , people who spent their childhood here .
so , next i got to the phone .
october , november , december . this is not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs on the time of the seasonal rains while the most prolific .
it &apos;s only last week , and the most important week , the most sophisticated , and now it rains there .
a pretty incredible deal .
incredible . this is the most prolific trip of a football trip , a pretty incredible journey .
i made that out of my life .
and everybody thought , i would be good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what about discussing ? &quot;
and in the night i looked at them and i asked them , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , pay attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve reached all this , what is it that you do , then , that &apos;s going to drive one , i &apos;ve talked about the most and other things , but what does it drive ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight is brought into an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of a set of license .
the chemical plant is on three square square kilometers .
after the war was there , there was a review of reference -- like it &apos;s the army that &apos;s always going to do -- and they asked the question : how many of the people have actually destroyed ?
i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a big city or a trip of this is the diversity of human species on amazing ways .
we ask the human ancestry .
but what data is the statements ?
imagine that they have to put together .
it was an african , which is based on the global diversity of the world &apos;s population .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are killing the animals that they were burning in the back of the world , they moved to north and followed about 45,000 years ago in the grasslands in the middle east in a rare phase of the sahara .
the human health system , the main health system on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from mush to complexity .
so there &apos;s .
what you see here is the blue areas are cooler , roughly a thousandth of a mere degree than the red areas .
the more than a nuclear gravity is working , which explains why they are and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;re familiar with the double double of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
you might ask yourself , &quot; what is the talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good if it &apos;s about insurance companies .
and then you have to decide how to invest in your 52 choices , and you never heard about a single kind of a car .
at least a wonderful study has predicted this .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one will get taken .
save more tomorrow , it just makes it .
that &apos;s just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called unfair , a creature that mimics a creature that is imitating a creature .
hello , who is because , please ?
thank you .
the knowledge has too much influence on the life of life .
i &apos;m trying to get time to be a little bit of time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine part of their divine part .
are you being a kid ?
elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to visit a friend of mine and he &apos;d wait to wait in his apartment apartment in the journal of the floor in the floor , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we &apos;ve lived from less than a dollar at a dollar -- for about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are more value than the forest as a forest . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who says to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just people ; it &apos;s about environmental terms .
if you should be a limited planet all over the way , how can we do this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , we had , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s global production , and 25 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy carbon in the trees to cross the water lanes of the internet , which is going to come to the place of the product to europe .
so the communication of the brain and spinal cord is interrupted ; this leads to a full and permanent paralysis of the leg .
after some years , it has been able to develop a monopoly monopoly , which is a pool of the spinal cord system that allows the nervous system to a sleeping in a broken state .
we &apos;ve been working hard about this goal to get this goal .
after a few weeks , we have a programmable pump to inject a individual , and a single kind of thing to put on the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the class .
he talked about the world , as she is , &quot; and the world , as you should be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women are doing many obstacles from the way .
in the white house , and the desk he sits on , is called &quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; .
the woman &apos;s last day , the woman who was running around everything , and we talked about it , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for this , this is a quantum record , a very popular thing to the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- how you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and orders .
one of the most popular websites in the world , which is run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that you could have done or google .
and today , wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can even find them on the cards of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia has understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s been training a little bit of the car .
why ? there &apos;s a more mature lining of a computer .
the world didn &apos;t end in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem on the ground is very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it became much done to give students to the same way to give up with the same opportunities .
how are schools going to be shown and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic systems , teachers will leave the teachers alone and have to keep themselves in a lot of the world .
some people say that change is a bit like a result of the world &apos;s brain .
but if you look at the issue of this perspective , you see what &apos;s happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked around the entire morning about 15 kilometers to get the ted book .
so this was obviously a kind of a device .
we could also do that with telephones .
so a business for you .
&quot; the government has to provide economic services . &quot;
it was once , long time , long time when i was 24 , i was at the age of st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my map when i &apos;m going to get it here .
and i also bring an invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is walking through a time of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided to invest not only in health and education , but also started to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the rich countries really accept a completely changed global economy , and the power power of there , where they were over the last 50 to 100 years , to 150 years , to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called &quot; dark energy . &quot;
but that explains the presence of the whole mass .
and now you pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of a model model of what &apos;s going on in the world &apos;s office .
they move from each other &apos;s way because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like galaxies -- their favorite , how many of you have a function of time -- we can bring in experience in experience of dark matter and dark energy in the driving world to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy you banjo boys : the ninth junior ... new jersey ?
so , recycling and linux are the most resistant to this .
marc blakley : the most innovative of the reasons to reinvent the
and in fact , these changes in gay men in the united states were in the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence gave us the spread .
it &apos;s very similar to a very similar amount of dna .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about diseases . that should not be a surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s medical &apos;s .
emily zimbardo once studied aids in africa from a economic perspective , and comes to a surprising conclusion : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this because i saw this kind of kind of plastic revolution .
he was called &quot; the &quot; bye &quot; , &quot; the first thing that he called , &quot; because he was on the front of the table , but every time he went to a tunnel , he was building a kind of a laser on the tunnel , and
this hump is going to work on the water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves why the membrane is destroying and how much electricity needs .
for example , in the design of the computer , in a material .
in the process of training , my favorite , i &apos;m working with the most powerful architect , we work with the ted system .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the business
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , no boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because it was now and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a very , for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most sophisticated movement in india .
let me tell you now from a project that we did some years later , a kind of a piece of captcha .
and basically , you &apos;re starting to do it by a old book .
the number of pages that are actually using recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words we &apos;re going to digitize a day is very , very large .
some are more fun .
and the web is divided in several languages .
then my favorite question comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a broken .
but what &apos;s perhaps more surprising is that the translations we get from the most of the time , even if you &apos;re just a parent that we &apos;re getting , the translations that we get is just like professional people , and that &apos;s very surprising .
and as you can learn , you can &apos;t use it with money , you don &apos;t pay money to pay them with your time .
the space lanes , the company , makes the business , makes it really good .
and the key participation is all other than normal .
and zipcar offers a very attractive , highly aggressive service , working fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal of everything else .
maybe these people have right . his thoughts is , &quot; well , maybe not good . &quot;
10 percent of the time time time , the thought of ... sex .
i played the violent africans , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , the first one was not a significant way to come -- so no one had reached the absolute majority -- so the election was kept in a second round three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we were that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we are being rejected from a particular reason and so .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to give you money , give you a building , and you can meet you , but talk not about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would be doing this as a little bit .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personal .
if you want to become rich today , entrepreneurs will .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up -- it doesn &apos;t go up at all . we &apos;re measuring it very carefully , and we &apos;re not measuring it for 20 years .
angela kary mullis talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own family in the garden and the curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a very simple way of being a living body that occupied this , rip into the space , abandoned spaces .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; naked &quot; model , which is the most sense of the way that the most of the world &apos;s mind is produced in a urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin has become one of my favorite favorites .
and the whole time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat on some of these places until recently , when i was on the london channels .
the first question is , and maybe you write them on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate in your head , and for the audience home , you can try that too .
and then we &apos;re going to interrupt , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific college in the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except that -- they &apos;re falling -- well , in their maiden trips , they thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , when people have a sense of what everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between organic , living world and the inorganic , the world &apos;s most unpredictable world .
and you can see , he &apos;s breeding , it &apos;s growing up in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked himself to a fellow who was a prime thing , that life probably came somewhere in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size , as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in terms of view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and can make matter to develop , then that &apos;s actually going to define life .
but there &apos;s another reason that i may be doing this , and that &apos;s why i think this is a single deal .
and these are highly professional female interviewer , which is an hour for a woman sitting on the day and ask her to ask her to be a woman .
i was really sitting at friday at friday my computer , and i could see how the mortality rate was on the morning of an ion professor on an m. side .
as you know , these economists love the money , they always want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make a difference to an average of improvement that has no been and this very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk so much about that .
in those days , there were high , or very high , child mortality and families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s a little bit more sensitive .
whatever remains is worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; put the thing in question .
the whole time was a border .
and then , after my opinion , the world will take forward , and it &apos;s going to make a difference , not just for some , but for everyone .
... above the knee , yes , that would be hard ...
the most important thing -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth gives enough to satisfy anyone , but not everybody agrees .
and babies die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific industry research -- 40 labs -- if two of the people don &apos;t have any languages , i built teams on it .
they &apos;re on the phone , and now i have apps in the app store .
it &apos;s about perfect and a little old to make a little old and a little old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but it &apos;s not a radioactive thing .
but there &apos;s not a lot of pressure that is not under high pressure , and it &apos;s not as reactive as the fact that the average is not that the reactor is not going to be .
i believe that the reactor i designed here is being a cutting-edge energy source that &apos;s going to provide great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really willing to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a belief experience where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the most powerful thing that &apos;s the case that they &apos;re going to go to the forest .
at the end of a long tense , he &apos;s talking to his son , he says , &quot; especially , &quot; is , &quot; especially , &quot; is the case of yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go in los angeles a lot , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot out of this town .
then they &apos;re being felt wrong when they &apos;re exposed to properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted and stayed for me .
then it was just about to start to start with a point and then to start building it .
so i made it concrete because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the mid-ocean days , 32 days , the poor and hands develop 36 days : the primitive spine starts to train this weeks , where the fetus is developing the fastest .
the complexity , this is in a single system , again , beyond every understanding or any of the math today .
because apparently there &apos;s no such unstable carbon &apos;s , not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with those spectra ?
recently , a colleague from berkeley sent me to berkeley , a email with a very interesting spectrum and said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about the world &apos;s and the stars , and the stars , and the chemical elements in the universe , are able to get overcome .
because can you imagine that everything is going to be done ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just standing on and say , &quot; we &apos;ll give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the air , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i was just saying , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is , you &apos;re universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly addictive to be a little bit skeptical , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- actually , that looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no , no , no , no more .
what &apos;s the feeling of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t have right . hold off .
we do that as if that &apos;s what we do , not a impact on other people .
people are making their meals in twitter , the ambulance of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , to make it systematic , we &apos;re going to think about how to make it useful , and then we think about how you can be useful to our own design of our life and to address our knowledge of knowledge .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , which is we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing that was the same implant , also these were the only kind of thing that was online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a data show , you don &apos;t have data , which is not going to be a scientific approach .
this is the curve over the ground .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to the end .
if we went from here to the first time , we would go to something that 300 feet high , 120 miles long , 28 miles wide , and that weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a car .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called hot .
and the reason is , networks are ideals of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the consumer risk .
so we could borrow a single advocate of every feminine set .
we see the emergence of the field and the building programs that are focused on understanding our connected world from the standpoint of complexity .
and the way that we have a nuclear capacity is a capacity to use a nuclear capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had a 500 of these profiles .
without human health .
so we were on top of our own .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that is invented .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a very powerful representation of negative to the positive in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our perceptual world , and the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the world &apos;s worth of life if i &apos;ve been able to make your entire external world .
and that &apos;s scientifically scientifically scientifically , and it &apos;s been wrong with it .
we &apos;re moving people to the people who are opening their own , a positive email of the world &apos;s or the most of the time in their social environment .
so , hard to say -- a more powerful , you understand -- my dad was the most popular man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , went down .
they said , do it stop .
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media company in tokyo .
listen to that ? how cows ? this is four o &apos;clock in logan .
so there are all these things to do , but most of the love i love to learn the world .
and i was going to be a passion .
your culture is not coming in schools , and i want to illustrate you , how we can overcome this problem .
that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools , who are not a young boy .
and over little moments in my life .
or moms who were raised to get the young ones ?
we need to change the posture of boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us the &quot; problems of &quot; why we can do the &quot; problems of nature in nature . &quot;
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end of memory , and i &apos;m also excited to be .
and that was really important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act at any object .
so , for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected by radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that goes on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a video of a game , so i put it around a car , so that people in the glass are different when you &apos;re on the surface .
i &apos;m going to transform in a man &apos;s middle ages , and then in a old man .
36 extra dimensions allowed .
radio : what do you think of ?
fold the wings together , and keep them going .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a different question .
and he had to put a royal scholar , with a little bit of the instruction , the instruction , and night , and the secret instruction , but with the secret instruction , not very well to be able to do it .
because they found that the human behavior is more powerful .
yet , we have to create a very clear amount of energy , which is what you can create , and it &apos;s a lot of fair fair .
now , if we have all these tools available , we just have to ask the question -- and we &apos;ve done this , and we &apos;ve done this -- how we use these smart ones .
they &apos;re taking the new york .
they give small , more cosmopolitan , more cosmopolitan .
i felt , passion , soul and hearts , left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not .
all around us around us , the other replicator is going to find a different replicator in this cultural field of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than the place for them .
we &apos;re the only one , and we &apos;re the only one .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to ban the resource of the planet to produce more and more and more amazing things , and other amazing things that we hear at ted .
and will we get through this third danger , how do we have been through the second and first time ?
in collaboration with the metal of the -- that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various forms of medicine , we use more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn 70 percent of my body , all of the time was about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good to get me in the pain of the pain to recover from pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most important people -- the ones who have more commandments -- was cheating , and that the less religious -- those who could remember almost no commandments -- more cheating .
so if you don &apos;t think of money directly for a few seconds because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most popular ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes the brand , and it &apos;s getting the food supply , defined how you want to spend money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems to be a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to tell you the audience , i &apos;ve got to explain it last week -- i &apos;ve been able to explain -- skeletons are structures that could transport sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most popular here , or even most animals , they don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by folded them on bones .
and that was that every skeleton that we found from the dna that we had found in nature , over the same level of noise .
all i showed that was really surprising .
a funny song about global warming , jill sobule .
well , i have to do it now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the other thing , the main challenge , and the aid , is the benefits of a great education .
the most popular thing is that it &apos;s totally about , and ben became a plastic company .
and then , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a little bit of the world .
but remarkably , the most dramatic of the united nations has estimated the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for this angle of labor in the world &apos;s market ?
they asked by governments to do management , and in many cases they have they get them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the goal of bringing new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful to be in his own bed .
since for the aspen , sir , and the british society thought of the british society that the sun seems to be .
so what is fusion ? here &apos;s something more powerful .
and this energy is that it &apos;s playing fusion .
so , about a conventional power industry .
we need to do it to a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also one with great influence .
it was , most of the time , they wanted to be most of the democracy , but they were the population of all countries who had been held in the last month in the last month , and they had been in the last month .
but the interest of people were really interested in the future .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s reading the message .
nobody can listen to them , just just just quiet a text .
you could see the immediate impact of laws or the one of the most profound speech , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 to 35 .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a more mature .
from the smallest side of the cliff , the sheer forces of the storms .
we can afford to do a individuals in this as individuals .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , somebody else , will solve somebody with more resources that will solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t fly it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s this one side of this incredible acupuncture , which is possible , and this huge serious thing that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral ancestry .
and the director was quite a boon and told me that he was mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a facility . these guys are tough offenders .
it took several of these events to find out what i should do .
when i started to do this program four years ago , my favorite plan was to create a computer plan of the computer plan .
and they look down for a little bit of the , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give my roles on a daily age , and go back to my country , where i &apos;m going to give this incredible rides with this group of children , in ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i understand that it &apos;s not existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
strangely , this knowledge doesn &apos;t mean my most remote sense of self-esteem , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have anything in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we &apos;re failing to the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and to be happy , what &apos;s next .
and this is a cafe in the u.k. in the u.k.
but instead of looking at this , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that as a structure of a structure and a more powerful way of getting this structure , we would have been found .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , which is , but that seeds -- in the world &apos;s most unequal gardens are not going to be made .
we worked with a design of the seed seed to develop a seed seed , so that even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it was kind of more profitable and soft , that &apos;s the piece that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few pies you &apos;re aware of , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book carries the title &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all his structure of his socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that you enjoy people &apos;s people .
it &apos;s still not clear , by the way , whether these generalizations are distributed , but the most important thing seemed to be to support this .
another one of the humanities and the university of the universities , who are in many ways in the demise of the demise .
well , the other hot hot is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell that better .
i also call bonuses , just like this , and they don &apos;t like it , but they don &apos;t like it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these things .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
your iphone without people who are the same skin , the same circuitry , the same keyboard , always and over again .
and then it became more powerful and more powerful and so it &apos;s a big thing for it .
and i said to brian , &quot; what does tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you &apos;re in the fake here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a regular way ?
so all of the things that came out of tony &apos;s morning is evidence of his clinician that he was crazy in this new way .
he came in failing in failing , and he was in the workforce 30 percent of the workforce , turning american cities in the workforce .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry is always the extreme aspects of the personality .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the rest of the world .
and as a result of that conversations , it &apos;s very difficult to say , i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west has been used , and that it was necessary in the framework of democracy against communism .
and although the president , from the reasons , was very , very good to get to the face of islam , not the enemy , there &apos;s nonetheless , a natural impulse in the other way to call the enemy .
when the treasure dropped in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best news , the scientists who had the scientists for african penguins -- that at this point as endangered species of art .
the day after the day , two of us were faced with the store of space , two of us , and space has been more than 4,000 with oil , and the two of them were more than 4,000 with oil .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explained to an endangered way of being an endangered way .
on the top row , at the time row , at the time , a newspaper ship , a very high school , in the coastal and even before the police station .
people are open for the most sophisticated .
we launched this campaign -- very supportive -- &quot; each egg counts &quot; every egg .
this is not a second class of the second grade .
this taught the lessons of the window , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s going to be you do is not do that , your neighbor &apos;s neighbor . that &apos;s the rest of the rest . the rest are comments .
now , that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body body and puts it carefully on the father , and the two men see each other and recognizes each other as divine .
this is what the cells really look at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these miniature clouds .
this picture was the beginning of the computer .
we all look at the same from the inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 millimeters of a thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s a pilot on the left .
it has human associations .
in the x-ray , we see all the little bits of dna in the corners .
i had to have the car in the middle of the center , for itself , not really simple task .
yes , you &apos;ve been given 12 monkeys a week for a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to throw a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not both telling us .
not professor and motivated , only two minds , ready to be ready .
and then my life was fine .
all i saw in the manufacturing process was that it was right intellectual between the u.s. and the most powerful .
would it be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time doing a billion dollars business , and you &apos;re going to be able to look at a billion of the dollar , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but then , later , more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these shell companies had rapidly their favorite , and the most important in london were very , very much of it .
that &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re going to die all the time . we &apos;re going to all be sick . we &apos;re going to leave all of these people .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to mind , which you don &apos;t think can be able to inhabit , worlds that you can &apos;t inhabit .
they have a more powerful and freedom of that i believe that it &apos;s a new kind of a new design system .
she made the decision to get no more , or not to get a more powerful or a half , but it &apos;s dedicated to the lives of that that this is not a little girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to give me this thing to the head , and then it &apos;s going to happen .
but that &apos;s not what you do . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find his staff , but he said , &quot; you go to recovery , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull it away .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most powerful thing , it &apos;s the way it &apos;s .
the characteristics that are the word , are so often seeing in adults that we should be able to eliminate this age , when it comes to the age of being behavior , to criticize behavior that is associated with the very irrational and irrational thinking .
when i was going to meet the ability of my sister to pay out 10 percent interest that i &apos;ve been struck by her last loan , i &apos;m going to be crushed by her ability to get more money from me to you .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all sound that we create people who are creating the most powerful .
this is after selective logging .
there are many of these strands of beans , among other things that are like the animals that are dancing and singing , and they &apos;re like that i &apos;m going to be a different time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb here .
so 37 is our forgotten .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually the heart of the heart .
one generation , which is so much more important from video games , when it &apos;s the real world .
all of these are problems outside my own .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
end ! end ! that &apos;s it .
it would be really good for him .
so , you get out of the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they &apos;re looking at them , and that &apos;s a heart -- i thought that at least , until they explained to me , that was , that was , to think about it , so they think .
it &apos;s going to be the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a plastic ball because it &apos;s two very different acts of life , and if you fall at the same time , maybe you might fall out of the street .
but we could train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a very important thing . &quot;
and ultimately , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re even going to come over this moment .
i &apos;m going to get your words back to the order of the order .
&quot; well , yeah , i said , &quot; strange , that you ask that .
and they said , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do again . &quot;
we looked at us , and i was grateful because they just said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s unacceptable . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the field of music .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the emperor of the japanese and the most exciting thing that has been given some serious problems in the project , problems that should not have been .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to want change , just right , if a computer engineer is the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that have been not seen , and that &apos;s just very quickly and simple .
yes , well , your guys &apos;s blown up my life because they were about , from beautiful galvani &apos;s form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most salient thing .
and i didn &apos;t really want to hire them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; took me a lot of time to the audience .
we &apos;ve been doing a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here , until we &apos;ve been reaching the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin , very thin things about the entire planet , and we had a very strict death of dinosaurs , the death of this beautiful , very , very much more , and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme seal , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us animals .
this is when material material comes from the deep earth and the surface , and the surface is distributed over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit of the coast from the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will saved , mentally .
so , the blessing , blessing and oscar .
some of you are countries who are the opinion that deregulation or even no regulation of governance is to promote investment , trade .
the answer is simple : the chinese are actually making these factories as chemical businesses , not as a matter of material , and they don &apos;t check it .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them together to create a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s a new way of the beginning of the financial regulation of international tasks .
human rights is to become a very simple question : can i give this people back ?
or the young guys who have laid out the fire to start the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and lightning .
again , we saw the spoken word word walls .
after the fight , he shook his head , he &apos;d sing hair , and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel much when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get their third step , but i had the happiness , and i was fortunate to see their journey as they did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a kind of a a book name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have driven me , to become a more powerful .
when i saw that the war for everybody who had such incredibly rich consequences and that the most important thing was actually going to be a factor in conflict conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population of the last phase of liberation was a last phase of liberation .
the next day i made myself on rwanda , and it was when i was up in the kitchen community in hell .
after the fall of the fall of the rock in indonesia , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to the modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders in refugee camp .
the most sophisticated thing is that the percentage of the soldiers that are surviving a drunk , in this war , is much higher than in any other history in our history .
so to make sure that so little can go wrong , we have all these procedures in choice .
so you &apos;re picking up this way .
but this is a broad and very difficult topic , so i had to be quoted .
the size is the population -- big china , here &apos;s big india .
and in all eastern religions , except japan was the same level .
because death is a child &apos;s disease with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job of design .
all religions on the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a business scanner .
day eight .
in india , my favorite friends , my favorite friends , and i went to door to the door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we did about a billion of the water .
this is the most important thing .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all of these things -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe debt to the somali and ron st. john , i hope ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , are you not angry for the insurance of the copyright copyright ?
have a set of a set of paper , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent power with a led that they used to use with a old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are pretty hard to be , and we had this conversation in business .
a more motivated school was paid himself in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 missions in the 1930s , 47 percent women are now 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap to the high management of management .
there was an equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this , he said , &quot; it &apos;s the continuity of reality . &quot;
somebody who makes it frightens or take a steam of the ears from the ears .
and the end of our computer process realized we had the openness of the other .
as i would go back to bangalore , i often go to a lot of too active discussions in my friends where we were working on different issues , while they were having a drink of a drink , where they were paying a drink of a drink , where
he looks for forgiveness , and he says that he wants to improve life of his child child .

i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the different kinds of data , because you can select what you want to highlight from the data data .
it &apos;s a very powerful man sitting in the box and controlled this kind of light .
a more of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a kind of a laser sensor , which is an ace of 68 cents .

and below all of the frames , the people who have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and put them together in the field of music .
and a naive consequence of this is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his picture , and that leads to a very free process .
and sometimes i have an emotional reaction to news , like the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i went 50 kilometers , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers we &apos;re made of , and what we &apos;re doing is to present the world as our identity .
another one of the other things is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it may be easier than ever before , to make a good increase .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly spongy .
it &apos;s just too weird .

they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down to three , three times the minute .
and i want to make sure that i did not do it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only one that i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already what we have today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a special band , like today , many of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have got the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the field of the world , in all ages , from the people , or we &apos;re eating children to the senior ; the whole spectrum of the disease -- i hope that &apos;s the whole spectrum of the disease -- i hope you
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the top of the world are enormous and the effects on disease are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain so-called alvin is created , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroyed all the system .

and it &apos;s a great thing .
snares should be faster .
you might ask yourself , how do we make these kinds of pieces of data .
our only cookbook is the world &apos;s only cookbook to be able to get the partial web .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the thylacine rings .
they had to give their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see , how it comes out there to do something useful , that &apos;s not that much as it can be .
and we don &apos;t even have to be quoted on this kind of thing .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was part of my fault .
we don &apos;t just have shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but that the openness of the future is enabling the value of the risk of the risk of risk .
the film we &apos;re going to see is done for the most important time in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it continued to go . they always tried to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house curved . &quot;
i think in my family , we have a lot of happiness , because we &apos;ve learned to go backwards .
and it &apos;s very good .
ed : and then , row row , in the place , is a historical star , and there &apos;s a place in the middle of the history of paris , and in the middle of the history of paris , the middle of the city has been the first

because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was a professional , and they were full of speculation . they were a full of speculation . they were a bad information .
one of them is known : the population population . the population has been growing by two billion people in the last 50 years .
brent ensler : being here .
you see the lines check out when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost of all the time , i have to hold very clear that i have to hold out that i &apos;m very clear .
so , in fact , it looks like this .
but only recently , we can , thanks to technical advances , now , the quantum locking and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it if you move , because your movements use energy , and so the most powerful way to get it .
and so , of course , this round magnet can expand , of course , to form an evolutionary rail .
and it was inspired by douglas adams , the situation is from &quot; clone through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do this , if you want to make it yourself , and not have a more powerful thing .
but even though they didn &apos;t believe they were , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot; -- you never have .
so , yes , i have .
so some of you will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law hits its borders ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and they &apos;re even better , because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been given a passionate talk on our own computer , which he would be doing for this , to put this big challenges of humanity .
they wanted to start the fish .
this may be insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening , listening to many rumors that another one of the other , more , more in the last , to get the last 13 &apos;clock , or maybe today , or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of analog moment , a moment where the blogosphere became an adult .
probably it &apos;s within three to five percent of the number of billboards in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has ties something , so others link , etc . , etc .
he stopped his favorite , and i &apos;m going to put on a 300 pounds of heavy paper with a lot of plans , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;

this habitat covered more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats .
many of us , i &apos;m locked in , think that the exploitation of the oceans are actually in the last 50 or the last 50 years , or maybe 100 years .
this is a cable connected vehicles , and your eyes for work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s really telling the computer what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we just don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand brand , which is going to appear in the scientific sciences in the scientific biology .
but it &apos;s not all that much .
as an architect , i have something to confront .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very encouraging , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the meaning of being in different directions : directions that are specific and unique for the problems .
now , we all think that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that we &apos;ve been writing a great romantic poet , a lot of us forget that he wrote some wonderful invitations , and the most famous essay is a name called the defense
i &apos;m going to read you .
and at a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest technology technology .
when you used to , before the digital radio , the railway ridge and the railroad station , he heard the way that it was that noise .
the idea of the brain revolution is that you have two sources of information that are the implications .
that means i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example where a person feels very different from me , when it &apos;s been produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person is playing .
if these dots were on a car surface , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to minimize the negative effects of noise .
this is from the marine iv city iv .
mars has the largest largest energy system of the solar system , the most prolific .
this is my favorite . it was taken just a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a very talkative called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the world &apos;s surface , oregon .
i think there &apos;s a lot of this in the packaging here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the most popular -- no , they don &apos;t stand on guns .
and then there are some examples of these things , and there are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , it had changed everything .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is the case of the trickster .
now , in brazil , there are 18 thousand miles of time , whereas the united states only own 700 , and the two of the people in california -- and within three years , the percentage is at the risk of four percent .
this is not a very big thing . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to cut the dollar lanes apart from greenhouse gases , and so quickly as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to do what we tedsters about the crisis of the crisis .
there are fewer people who are still available , which you could be collecting , and then you get this kind of thing that &apos;s going to be the trajectory of the curve and you get this classic trajectory .
b is at the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to each other .
the red dots will be the most powerful , and the yellow dots will be friends of the people with flu .

but today i &apos;m going to talk about the free food , which was this year , last year , and in 2008 , and in 2008 , there &apos;s enough food for the other time .
and i go into this stores when you &apos;re there , or out in the fields to see what you can get , and i find it , you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of the schools in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in an emergency program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing at cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a more mature street .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a kind of a device , not because it shows me how many of these things i &apos;m going to do , but because it &apos;s been charged by 24 hours , what i do .
that &apos;s never shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron of a neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and its resolution goes up enough , then you can actually all be the proteins in the body , and start to understand the individual system .
most of us are comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about a sleeping person .
so , if i go to this -- -- longer than a few seconds , you would feel uncomfortable ; you would feel uncomfortable , and you would have to go to the hall in play .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve all seen . and that &apos;s the tune that &apos;s at the most common place in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard corbusier and kevin gardner .
as we cross miles and miles from the world &apos;s board -- frozen , the most flexible that could be the most powerful .
so as i &apos;m standing here today , and you talk to you about the most about five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the northern coast of deep feet .
the ocean and the weather and weather , they keep the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
so , there are easy ...
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know that there &apos;s borders for what we can take out of the ocean .
for example , the united states has been good for example , the u.s. &apos;s square square square miles than a nuclear weapon .
we need space strands , new technologies to explore the ocean .
a lot of my early career i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual imaging of a mouse from jeff , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re making a laser test to get some behavior , another kind of social experience , a different kind of social and patterns and you can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more flexible and realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home , and she &apos;s drinking tea .
when you look closer to the neocortex of the neocortex , you &apos;re making it louder , and you &apos;re making small components , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the components , like a computer .
how many per type of tree is there ? where are they turning it out ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it turns out , and watch what happens .
so , the other thing that &apos;s called the secrets is that the secrets of the brain can soon be solved , mental , memory , perceptions : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s trying to do it with a supercomputer that &apos;s going
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started that .
this is what nasa did to get a design of a design that would fly for mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people to think of this question , they usually think that it &apos;s going to do something with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones who give a lot of them , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it gets back to the point , and it &apos;s more complex .
a online acrylic for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is , we don &apos;t know that we really don &apos;t know so well .
in fact , in medical minds , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- you can only use the eyes of the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very quickly activated and it can be shut off very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just the way .
cars have a lot of time and the other , and we can communicate and communicate through the surface traffic traffic , and you can communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean , which is all life .
it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome of the genome , and the power of this is a connective medicine that is better than today -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- just a ride , but we could completely reconstruct it .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms alone on the world , but are part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re destroying or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of us .
now , i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in dog dog in the moment where we have a person who thinks that you have a dog feeding , first by making rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; just beating . and therefore you get beaten .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to do it six to 10 .
these are like golden dancing .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be it .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are the same things that they &apos;re doing .
their children are just training .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think working with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard to make them sound out of it .
and less , if it &apos;s accompanied by the most powerful and more of the time , how in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 multiply .
let &apos;s see the third question .
the desert expands a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus introduced the same tool over 30 generations .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s also a more powerful thing in other animals , but the exchange of one object against another is never happening .
it &apos;s the wealth of the ability to save the human needs , time .
we &apos;ve been able to get this species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to think of objects like this , that was a clue that exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also about the connections that people are taking into , and that &apos;s not where they &apos;re still going to be able to meet ideas and mate and mate . i &apos;m also sure the technology continued to expand and improve the open-source level .
this is as high as a building building . i &apos;ve been here for the profile as compared to comparison .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
these are just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most sophisticated detection detection detection , then the problem is the problem , because how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
i &apos;ve talked about this -- you know , you know , if you don &apos;t get diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we did a part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new , so far , they &apos;re very repetitive .
after 10 more days , she came back -- still a fever -- she &apos;s still -- she &apos;s got a little bit of oxygen -- it &apos;s a little oxygen in her lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could already .
let &apos;s roll something that fits the web of the car .
i brought a high density up with lower density , a high density of dense density , and a light of salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants a design system , and so he &apos;s building -- he &apos;s building the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the south pole . six kilometers before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast , about 20 meters below the surface of the surface .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to be interested in mary , and how they were interested in this kind of thing and how they thought it was , and how important they found it , kids discover things , and they &apos;re not taught to be prepared to open up a kind of
evolution often is seen as this one way that we chose , but it represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;ll skip this to the stage of space .
our cities are at risk , because many of them are on the coast .
there are stars and so on .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior , or language language , like the social social scientists , it turns around language . so , we think about communication .
this expression , as a pride , was known as jessica tracy , she showed that people and from birth were blind people , doing this , if they win in a single car .
so i thought about this . you know , you &apos;re looking at these people and see how they participate . could you get them to be able to fake it and then get more involved ?
what happens to a computer show , what happens when you go on the top stage ? how does the following manipulation , these tiny little bits of manipulation ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where you can actually apply that ? that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
these things are like this , and people are actually showing their true self .
she was completely depressed , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look at this . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other path of life .
and the point of swimming in order to get out of your body , and the way to get your own , and then you get a little bit of the brain , and you &apos;re going to go up and drive a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , you have to have an answer .
so , it &apos;s like i think richard and i care that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re extinct in the essence of the way .
but under all these ideas that are going to be spreading in the world , we &apos;re going to spread a lot of toxic ideas .
and as viruses , we should not try to destroy them here .
and in my game , that &apos;s what you call the most powerful .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went to tour international .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of humble fashion model .
i don &apos;t want to know that that should have happened , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answering questions that you have to take in mind , if you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save a life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a car , and she &apos;s explained that she &apos;s not going to have married any children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and went to a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you will be the best talk you &apos;ll ever regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and his basic value was respect to strangers .
who fights , while he goes ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more , more and more , it has been a income , and it has been now a income to support your family .
just go to somebody else , with another culture , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and connected to it in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start there where the story started , 1985 in 1985 .
now , before you &apos;re running out of the way , who had the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this less famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functional shower .
21 percent of what we repair are consequences from the world &apos;s brain , things that were actually wrong around .
we did this . he brought it up .
we found later that in this region , the leading cause of disease and death is the cause of disease .
one thing is in relation to everything we &apos;ve done , the middle of the world &apos;s brain , nelson mandela didn &apos;t get far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not intuitive . she &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t feel like you call me a little bit of a laser . really not .
it sounds really evident to say that , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
and with this statement , i &apos;m going to take you to the point that children don &apos;t want to leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest of civic labor in america with our own financial heritage .
this is a picture of the mayor of bronx bronx who received kids in his house , not in jail so that they felt like they were going to be a computer .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small , you &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , what &apos;s cool , and they create these accountability under the sound of the sound that is incredibly .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold out children from the stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s going to expose south bronx
secondly , bet that even you &apos;re seeing the difference here as an emerging market , the difference is a rising increase right after that sharp line .
to 10 : 16,000 suffered the pig was a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine a aura , a band , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute to the top of the road .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine migraine , and we need a design system . i think we &apos;re now .
my first wish is that the most important thing for epilepsy , the most important , for the epilepsy , for the most of the time , is used to the treatment of the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take care of the hope in the hope of sexual stocks in the hopes of colorful stocks that the poor patients are using full of pity .
a year ago , four of the five years ago , four of the u.s. scientists were at ushahidi , which is called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system .
how do you know what &apos;s important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got the first time to get it to this .
these people are calling out the barrier , because they &apos;re going to be out of the process , they &apos;re going to share with the world with the world .
they have to use connexions as a platform to develop their materials and to develop their material , and they teach them to teach them to teach them .
yes , books , maybe 100 or 1,000 spending of that will be sold in the year .
it &apos;s not surprising that it &apos;s all like , &quot; well , it &apos;s all like , &quot; right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most popular , when people say , &quot; so we &apos;d like to have three or a half of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a magic project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a few thousand children with two more .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things around the way , stare on screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better opportunity . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing lucy , &quot; i love lucy , &quot; on a big line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a pregnant mother , always their child , is suspended .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , the most profound thing to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mothers who came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , how simple is the system .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , it takes a childhood to what this graph shows . it &apos;s the early adolescence in the early adolescence .
the idea that her father in the public was singing , and she was going to be a little bit of her .
this is the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the mid-ocean peninsula museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a lot of time online , 24 hours a day .
but in the night , while we were running , i asked the chief , how the most popular would have decided that they would kiss sam anthrax .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place that my family has been working on for four generations in the u.s.
so , i don &apos;t know what it has to do with the shepherd , but they &apos;re incredibly reactive .
the first thing you see in the field of the brain is the terrible force of the internet .
he puts it up to my leg , picks me up , brings me up to a car and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct , we have the end of the direct world .
so it just just as easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect to the kind of technology as technology .
it &apos;s the most powerful of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of people who are already in the world .
i &apos;ve led three main classes to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and what land they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important , very important tool for birds , one of the most important most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re going to stand in front of the rest of the world .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse fishing . &quot;
of course , the most popular and open lake was the open sea , but the most dramatic , the one that everybody wants to look at was trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of light and huge amounts of water .
now there &apos;s a lot of water , immediate , automatic , an automatic , accessible , accessible , accessible , for free to the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no one answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data going to say ? &quot;
instead , he has been very careful , which is what happens , and then when technology comes to the first time , when technology comes to a community and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves , painting .
i mean , that was at least how happy it made me .
now , there was a question of , of course , a question that i had a while in the head , and i can do it , well , can i do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those i
and here &apos;s it on the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without any way to go .
they &apos;re being manipulated in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was regarded as an extraordinary talented in the peer-reviewed , because i knew the most popular thing , and i know how to use it , and i can do it quickly with the ted process .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in such many of my friends who in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 90s , and &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s , and doctors and doctors .
as a christian , a christian , and made out of the plastic of the world , young jewish men were made in the united states and canada , and superman &apos;s batman and superman who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim europe , the last muslim europe .
the biggest bad man , the most powerful , doesn &apos;t want that rocks to get the muscle out of the boat , so he &apos;s trying to stop it at the time .
and one of my favorites is kiki from yemen .
&quot; and when is the article out ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s got to give you something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of a group is extremely identified .
brené blakley : the lessons of islam
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight you for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i &apos;ve discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then the concepts come to this .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that these kinds of visual information is a form of the information .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to deal with you , because they &apos;re visual .
the most popular thing is named the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell the potato or the internet ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after several months of search , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call the kind of molecule that you &apos;re called , and that &apos;s what kind of vibration has .
this is the basis of the device that these two people have built by ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just smell like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
and the time is a series of things that i want to pay attention to .
and she actually didn &apos;t have a notion of the context that she was running .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye to my mother , neither my father , my father , my brother , my brother , my brother , my roommate , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents .
i cover it . i just reports about saying that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do , which was one , my family and the other thing was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us running around and find small pieces .
he had a computer service and he has to be very precise from other female , female and probably smaller family members to reach his age of 12 years .
is this a good adaptation or is it going to lead that we will be the elders , the most conservative way of the planet on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature from the way ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a train store , and i wanted to buy a car program -- we had a design program .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my suggestion : about 70 layers of this , and it &apos;s about 70 layers of paper .
do you know how obsessed i really am ? this project is only for me , and yet i went so far to ebay with a chinese newspaper from the san francisco of san francisco to get the bird reasonable ...
when we &apos;re going to go to the top of the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect , a perfect , an awful piece of ice , and the smell of the absence of the insect and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , only with a football system . &quot;
i remember that my father was pushed me outside a wheelchair , and i was off up to the top , and i felt the first time the sun was on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll be going to be next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was staying the phone phone , and i called the flight flight , i was going to go and say i &apos;d like to a book book .
and i said , &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m in the very literal way .
it &apos;s like a computer designer &apos;s worth of a gentleman flying through a richard serra .
how to do this , as hell , i should do a telephone in three weeks when i have these things that have been developed over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of an object .
in his days , he was the highest loan in british .
i look at individual pieces of paper , and how they flow -- how they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most powerful thing . it was made of aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water reef .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural for me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
and after i did my dr. , i had the lucky fortune to be member of a computer scientist who used it to the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most popular things .
he uses red bioluminescence like a football system to be a plastic of animals , and they &apos;re going to be a red light to be blind , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and find partners .
i &apos;m going to give you another science that &apos;s still used to hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made the value of sleep .
and on june , i heard a loud bang on the disk , which changed my life and ended up a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
and after the price , my life is changing .
another example of the effects of the brain &apos;s life on the life of birds .
so , if i like to say something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear music , and we did .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; from martin luther king , and the other is by hitler .
now , you can see more and more more and more , the former general independence is now the most powerful .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used against a used . &quot;
absolutely crucial .
and what happens when teachers want to make order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so , freedom has a water structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest , largest change , and the biggest change : we need to get the authority to the interpretation and shoots of the law .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise , it &apos;s going to be incredibly sealed .
so , the limits for interest , the most important to the interest , can calculate the number of people that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to copy , and it &apos;s really hard to start with a ruler .
he had paid a very bad job .
he was just a single camera .
but the problem to leave on rules and incentives is that they were compelled to do the job of doing action , and they demoralize their job in two ways .
so , wise design systems are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some wise nuclear rights points can be upright for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be a lot of food .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to put a little bit more elaborate , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- at the time .
this was a little bit of the turtle , the turtle .
we have a complete deal of this with a complete wall .
what i want to show you is what they needed to transport 34 pounds up to the age of uranium .
what if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the load that you just saw , somewhere in the back of this .
part of the problem is that the most important self , the most profound self , is the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me from someone who &apos;s a computer company , which is a very powerful one , the fact that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there that did the wrong things , and the problems have still ordered the problems .
we can show our results . we can make the things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s a very dangerous environment to have a dangerous environment .
imagine we could , because if we could , we could reach more .
governments who do most of the progress are the governments that have found ways to allow the ways to make shared value in business , rather than seeing the government that has the unique people .
maybe i can cut the brain here , and i can go to look at my brain .
i want to zoom in .
come on a moment with me in the 19th century , right in june , june corbusier .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look down to the british government to get money for building the money of babbage &apos;s machines because they believed that these machines would have tremendous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just make less wealthy men , but they also get upset about the world &apos;s rights , rather than answering the questions of the world .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person has written a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those not old enough , they have no idea how these infection happened -- that &apos;s through these storms .
there are about 10,000 programs vaccinated .
this would be the frequency that you can find in the world that &apos;s been written in the other 26 letters of the ideal of the world in one of the random elected monkeys .
everywhere life is , you will have these distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot .
the officer says , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you lost this one ? &quot;
these are the data from one survey to the computer in zambia in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago , which i have been tuned .
as you see , bruce willis had a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 dollars , or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time or it held in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have a vacation in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that enables them to do the self without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than i made when i was filmed for two weeks when i was a chemist .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather .
i promised that i would take the next time i would fly around the world , not take fuel , not going to be a fuel , and be safe , not to be threatened by the most sophisticated .
i think you need a pilot to talk to the universities who can talk to students , who can speak to students , with politicians during the flight of flight , and it can really make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that these minds are welcome to this group of life .
now you just need one laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was an ancient place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is what this problem is , and what it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop with a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we &apos;re the first generation , and this extreme poverty can see the eyes , you see it , and you can tell it . it &apos;s like , you know , we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s a nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the hejaz states , who &apos;s been introduced and the history of the world .
people are starting to find this .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups that are out of the energy and the enthusiasm of there out of hollywood to the interior of hollywood .
step for step , you move forward , a nurse , a teacher , a nine-year-old , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all their lives , can change a country -- and a continent of it just to be analog , because to get your head off .
lips are no lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to see what this forms is bouba and which is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just going to be a little bit of it , this sentence literally is , literally wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare that to what we already know about what &apos;s unknown .
nadia al-sakkaf : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t fit all of these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think i &apos;m .
how do you handle it , but you also have your own , but also with your favorite ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
so this shows a very clearly image of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt like a high fat and a cheese sandwich , you probably land on intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for the ted , and i had to go back to the street , knowing that i would never see my home again .
i was sitting there and i talked little to the screen screen for the transplants and asked him what i would like to do when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was hanging on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these most popular things is also in the united states to get 200 percent .
and also , interesting that the same business that is sold to the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the same thing , &quot; is sold to the antidote to the same
we started as a design model .
what would our constitution tell us , if you go back to child , and i had a little bit of a bit of a bit of artificial , some artificial , and a little bit of a crude satellite detector .
the problem is you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , not seeing this connection .
here &apos;s the scene of the computer satellite building next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every time i had a ride .
the most important thing is that it &apos;s not being contained in the world .
here you see , in red , the spread of the ocean .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of them remain hidden .
they look from their boat , and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to something that &apos;s called the &quot; repetition . &quot;
the redwood tree is the redwood of the earth &apos;s stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely impossible to see .
but for a recently , all doors of the palace are open and break the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s take a look at the first time for example .
how do these people do these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch it , how do we work -- how security security -- and try to find a way to get the most powerful thing to do .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a very large amount of view there : the d layer / d , and if you open up this image file on your computer , this program is downloaded and passed it .
and if you look closer at the images of the scene , you can see that the computational record is the computational .
we need to make a way to make sure that everything works , even if the computers are out .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything .
this person is around with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
this powers completely disappeared , no one &apos;s most prolific .
it would be good if people would be threatened , and they would take this kind of calculations seriously and they would be able to deal with it because this would change things . but it would change things on two more and a half ways .
that means that we can see a copy of ourselves when you just use one part of the most powerful , that is moving into slow and worse health and a more productive and more stable .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their favorite , and they saw their video suddenly spread as a football machine .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go away .
this is what was taught him to do it since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor , like mau , who taught me how to live .
what is it that &apos;s going to be driving you today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and you make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , or unconscious , in the moment you decide to focus on something you can focus on , you can make meaning and whatever it means , it makes feelings .
you ever have what , and you &apos;ve got to go , &quot; that &apos;s me ! &quot;
to death , so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the movements in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in occupied territory , someone in new york , who died if he had been working on the day at work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and he said it .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools with which a large number of people can tell their stories , people everywhere around the world .
the color of the particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day at the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts running , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .

i went to the children as often as possible to bring the academic stuff to the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all that , but it &apos;s an incredibly empowering summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details why we think the universe is so much , but it &apos;s made from mathematics and trying to explain the physics that we know .
but in my career , it &apos;s always saturated in me .
in 2001 , i visited her during a prison shop .
we got a lot of business tools .
this is the first degree of the last week in 2004 .

each of them will have a student student , but in various scientific disciplines , it &apos;s been specialized .
i have my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a real great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he said this is the most beautiful brain he ever has .
so the next few slides i &apos;m going to tell you about is a little bit .
transistors are getting smaller , and that &apos;s what we did , and that has made our technology much better .
and our favorite is behind this lens .
i had such a gut gut that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call them the most powerful of the world &apos;s brain , because they &apos;re kind of more nuanced .
we can see more details in our galaxy , and we can see somewhere else .
and this brings us to the last one factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other one is being rejected in the other and the cloud .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and fire baseball .

well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; gapminder innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we &apos;re going to get amazing talks from them .
let me introduce you to this point sam , and let me introduce .
but even if you get the screen back , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how to promote the world &apos;s innovation is about developing innovation .
first , i have to take a service to the audience , and from the talk , what i &apos;m going to give him , rather than saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re going to be fun to design their own ultimate or ultimate tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of
this kind of tests are taking up , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s in transparency , choice and accountability that people have really power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , famously said , in the world , more photos of their mind than any other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers were taking the most powerful and ion form as helpful contributions , because they took a specific amount of information that is a sense of a sense of life .
so i wish all of a nice weekend .
reading dna and writing , always become easier and cheaper .
michelle works alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a museum of a college ? &quot;
if you have all the world &apos;s data , this can lead to a very large one , who allows you to do biotechnology .
the kingdom says his laws allow him to be alien , or foreign , or a risk of health , or a risk of health , or the risk of health care , or the values of state .

also , jobs should be shared .
their liver is the largest .
and they were killing about 12,000 sharks at the time , by actually being a very talkative from the computer in the bay island in the island of bay island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is a place that &apos;s going to find the place of a shark depending on time and the sunset and the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the wingspan of what &apos;s going to be done with the genes that are passed by parents , we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , they have a little bit less diversity than others .
so this research came up called and found that the size of the 9,000 is .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say , if you were from a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the merchants .
their bodies are broken up with the steel and they &apos;re also used to be used for any of the food tools to make money -- people tell themselves many such stories .

and i think that i was saying that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was to photograph in the partial , because there was a million different types of gay artists .
at least i hope that it &apos;s going to be harder , your human rights is going to be more difficult .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most powerful thing .

on three ways , the most accurate way is called the most effective way .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when he &apos;s going to do something ? &quot;

and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that really has been very difficult to teach .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , it &apos;s a very clear one , which is a red arrow .
there &apos;s just a reference principle , which is the body .
i promise i don &apos;t say anything about it , except that it &apos;s going to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has expanded , think , imagination , imagination , and language .
thank you . thank you for $ 700 -- and the fiddler .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m just ridiculous to make me ridiculous because i think feminism has partly the task , to admit the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can now see , i don &apos;t have to put myself on fire .
she talked about the research , she started to play her , she &apos;s organized , she &apos;s going to play friends -- all these everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this perception that is different to the homo sapiens of earlier .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electrical activity in my brain while i think that talk .
we &apos;re making a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that can control , as thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
this headset is wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the most harmful and more prolific social media systems are moving , which people are diagnosed with , to see themselves .
it understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re going to change on humans changes , changing , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my ability and my opportunities .
expand , and so , they put it on .
this specialist didn &apos;t mean to look at my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and it &apos;s very , very slow .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me , not really , not all the stocks of mine , all of us , all of us .
that &apos;s me . i &apos;m all my whole .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but at one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just a small change in the position of the posture , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that needs to be that &apos;s going to be about the level of control , which we have over our tax tax .
for the most of the time , you could have put a lot of money in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the usefulness of the usefulness would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full of one of the other things .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a behavioral discipline of the human psychology .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it will be a lot of them that they don &apos;t even get to hurt themselves .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that didn &apos;t mean i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had focused , really strong effects in children around the world , and now in humans every ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , that wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan cousteau &apos;s name . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have cerebral gases .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s play , which he completely created in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , we do a design problem .
there &apos;s a present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last time time machine , is something that i &apos;ve done with hal &apos;s worth , which was introduced me from my co-author at a previous project , bill chaucer .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people affected , because if one of the faces smile , then the other face is flashing .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we do for western science , mathematics and engineering , actually in the first few centuries of our food system of the world &apos;s food , and we developed the most sophisticated and more and more powerful .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not a sh .
so surprised that if you &apos;re talking about mental illness , you probably have stories of the world &apos;s suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all of the life of life .
a little more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world were given in the world &apos;s lab and gave this legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard of fish .
and look at this profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early &apos; extrovert , when india wanted to drive his favorite power -- as an instrument to the sink -- to china , with his hull growth from eight , nine , 10 percent , and asked himself , why can &apos;t we do that ?
it &apos;s not a happy way to put it , but you have trust and the courage , and the courage to say , &quot; we calculate .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together together combined 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things mean , dick , not -- &quot; not sydney . &quot;
i also liked these intellectual journals .
and he said he had basically the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed all the time , and the color color , which is just rolling up this amazing aluminum aluminum system .
many of these ideas were produced in the trailer , and they produced the trailer .
if you think about them , their children at tinkering school are going to come back to the phone , they &apos;re going to come back and forth .
but let &apos;s play it under your own conditions , and trust me , you &apos;ll learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the most of the time of the world &apos;s brain .
if you want to throw a device next time , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all this . this is number five inches . okay .
so here you see sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife sitting here today , four months after , in aspen , and in the good constitution .
how about a completely unfair tool , not just the sharing ?
this is one of the seven times the other population of existing , which has not been shot in all .
and so , in the years , in the 1930s , in the 1930s , there was all of western europe to go to the first of the western , and then thousands of thousands , and then , finally , millions and thousands of individuals , which should be
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison the light bulb , she saw about this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a college season , that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , and it &apos;s going to bring it far in the world .
they literally have the door to get rid of us .
if you listen to the most of your life , both ears are both at the time .
we have the problem that is edited out .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and plastic systems .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated materials from the contaminated rabbit .
and i drew their own special map , and i wrote their name on it , and they were sending them to them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be in .
and i believe that it &apos;s a very important thing to do , my valuable and limited life on this earth .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we &apos;re thinking about future technologies . we start the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the rna mechanisms that you have different charges .
and through a sequence of the brain , you can be one billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the search of the box .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to doing something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have these days where you wake up eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or to seven or when you &apos;re up , you say , man , i don &apos;t have good sleep .
in the office most of the armies , they are most polite , and distractions that are actually going to prevent people from work , to be more inspiring .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that employees will be .
now meetings and managers are the two main main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week , no one can talk to that .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this already seven years and have no idea how the future will look .
but if you ask people to ask the three most important things that they carry , no matter what culture , which is gender and what context -- most people say , key , money , and if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big , but we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the car , and then the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent of the car , and there &apos;s the rest of the bar on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he &apos;s kind of a recognition of the values of rotating speeds .
at the same time , the world &apos;s spread is a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about later .
what do we do ?
dean ornish shares new findings that show how the verbal relations can influence a human lifestyle on genetic level , and he says , if we live healthier , we &apos;re actually eating better food , exercise and love our brain cells .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is to be able to do a few days back to a fortune .
and i used to say , i &apos;m a computer scientist .
i thought i &apos;d try to try to address my ted wish , which i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits what you &apos;re trying to do .
no one in india . now , there &apos;s at least half a million active .
and i came to think that someone in this whole non-governmental world have to think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to that : less than four tenth of one percent of those who were treated , stopped the rent of their drugs or left their treatment .
it &apos;s a try to value and i think it would be successful .
the desks are not square .
if it &apos;s used , it &apos;s going to produce 8,000 watts of electricity , and day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
the local women from bali cooking food on the ground and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied that .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal , were still healthy and not any of the failures . &quot;
then apple came out of alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard .
there was one reason for that : that was me .
the most important thing is not .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about .
at first , the internet was a kind of a tool for me , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real daily life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing turing .
i was an architect before , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treated two of these pages as one side , because it &apos;s the only one that &apos;s going to take readers .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;ve been taking it from .
it &apos;s been happening and terrible things happened with me .
all of these lost hope in my healing .
so they went to their own , and they all collected their own furniture furniture -- they gave me pots and whatnot , and they were doing everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars go down and forth and forth and they had a horrible accident that they put in these kinds of things .
i thought that some reason that i had been left is just the time and just for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the ted bank of the street .
can we say we &apos;ve all discovered the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it off because i &apos;ve built a little bit of a barrier , right ?
if i rotate a magic train , and then one , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws of how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , this is a symmetry called the &quot; test . &quot;
instead of all the confusion , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need to have the last name . symmetrical objects basically -- please spell it for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter , maybe shorter .
thomas edison had a very crappy software company in a software company today .
penicillin was discovered , but even the 1940 , and the most of the time , no commercial and a pharmaceutical material was made of it .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s brain , which had last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson is unintended consequences that chaos now is happening . let &apos;s do the best of it .
working on every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus , and the text is getting smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete them even more .
and so , a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired to inspire me to do my real desk .
a means that it would be like a more powerful thing , so you get more traditional desktop , and things are made up to grid .
now i get the hearts of the people who are getting the heart of people and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with a bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to rethink contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just just , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies , which may have been on amazon .
these are not the same things ; that &apos;s culture .
you can take it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s a heat system of them .
the answer is to allow cars to come safe from this side of the road .
warren buffet had a recommend : say , &quot; what works and what &apos;s not going to do and make this happen ? &quot;
in fact , we see the genetic response that it &apos;s the only disease because of the only human living people in africa , even a lot of things have been formed to avoid the energy system .
this means that the economy in these areas are sort of hitting these areas because it &apos;s just so much stopping .
but there &apos;s no more no more sophisticated .
not only was it weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top neighborhood is going to be the performance of his class -- measured in a year of 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and those free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everyone with access to a drug that can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
when i look at these pictures , i &apos;m going to go back to the smoke of my clothes when i went home to my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to hold us for so powerful ?
this is general general in boston .
the bonus takes the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s looking at it under the microscope and then informed the operating room .
so in this sort of editing , a solution to these bracelets , with a gene molecule , with a gene gene , here is green , and it &apos;s actually being able to put up the cell cancer of a cancer cancer , can &apos;t separate normal tissue .
with the lymph nodes , as part of our today &apos;s favorite , the surgeon is looking for the individual node , the lymph node , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause the spinal cord , and pain .
if we put these two samples together ...
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of dna that we learn .
it &apos;s going to affect the normal circuits as the sick , the ones that they want to fix .
and in the morning in 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short amount of cells are going to be enough to do this cells to drive learning .
and it &apos;s going on . now .
i want to end with a story of that we think might be a clinical application .
now you can see that the animal is actually the walls , and it can use its eyes again , and then it can use its eyes .
buildings are parked with the air , and they &apos;re blowing microbes through the windows and about mechanical mechanical equipment .
and if you &apos;re out there , the air contains microbes that are associated with the most common and dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i had no concern , this thing , i don &apos;t have to worry about that thing 20 blocks .
the same thing is , who after 9 / 11 was living the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and look at google after , and then you look at this data for someone &apos;s name .
this is barbie &apos;s surface . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of you are link to one .
what was common for us 40 years ago -- that &apos;s telling stories between generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .
was the story good to tell ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as reading ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send them to a noun : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of california as a single condition of cancer , and the other thing that will be seen and other kinds of other things . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more sophisticated , humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s a bad accident that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the eternal source &quot; has been mentioned for &quot; the eternal . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was : &quot; end the stone stone , &quot; didn &apos;t end up with the stone . &quot;
and that can be all right for berlin , but we did just go in houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously didn &apos;t have designed for the use of air , it &apos;s actually a vertical of the water .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been able to put the 4,000 at most common , we &apos;ve been in a database of the most common , which we &apos;re going to provide in six weeks of the public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy life &apos;s life , learning the internet in the internet .
we started commercial and mixed use of buildings so that all people and places have to have centers where they can stay .
and this is the most important thing that &apos;s called utah in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell anybody that we already knew that , because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , they have started that the most important thing in microsoft started 11 / 11 in 2007 , in the 12th of march 2008 , and then the other google , facebook , japan , and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden has similar laws like the united states .
and who also tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time .
their email were read and they talked to the most in the prison and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no law on privacy , there &apos;s no more information in the brain , and therefore no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks different if you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas where the phone cells are running through .
and the nature of a particular cell , which is to be able to make the odds , is that it &apos;s determined to be what the 25,000 genes are on and what threshold they are on .
now experts come into play and make basic anatomical practices .
we take the principle of the material and put it on a so-called unfair machine .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
you &apos;re looking at your entire genome and you &apos;re trying to find a lot of the genome that are linked to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eliminate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all right .
and there were many experiments that all came up with the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to talk about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to drive politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re working .
to diagnose poverty is more acceptable than a scientific work and a lack of data about the effects of the impact of the brain of the brain , the question of how to get this one . but esther duflo says it &apos;s possible to figure out what the aid
so we start , because africa is on a certain way , in the sea change .
and the legend reported that alexander was walking through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to discuss this from the perspective of the capital capital .
in tanzania , last week , the standard of the standard was launched for the financial community .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was the world &apos;s best performance in 2005 ? &quot; you would think in egypt ?
because there &apos;s amazing opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we want to be , and to feel inspired by the universe , which celebrate life .
you &apos;re going to put a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to leave that to you , so you can sort of pick that up and describe my reactions as i saw the first time .
right .
ok , keep your hand , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , one .
just if you want the pressure down , you make a more powerful , and you just , but only if you want the pressure off .
do you want to try it ?
you feel a certain sense of emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the bottle of the bottle into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the blink of the game .
kb : ok . do you think he &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry , how our brains can make our bodies , are working with a trick of the brain , and then he &apos;s working on the audience in some incredible moves of the brain magic .
i &apos;m going to get up .
this is not for the one of four , and that &apos;s for all four .
i watched that both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most important thing is almost zero when there &apos;s no stimulation to make any stimulation .
you get the following message , and you get a lot of money to get this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is the generosity to be fed by the training of 80 percent .
i &apos;ve just found this molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what shall we do ? &quot;
we have testosterone of these men .
and that tells us that we invented this ritual , to connect us with this new couple of emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain to the brain .
to run the device , you need lots of people , lots of people .
or should you not mind that ?
they were quite covered , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that only works english , so we taught ourselves english , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
absurd . but i had to rule the norm .
how will tomorrow be ?
we need to do this imbalance , to make a difference from threat .
i think there &apos;s a focus in this right here .
i &apos;ve asked an incredible question -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will it end ? &quot; -- from nine-year-olds .
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the thread .
he went to the local pradesh of the local pradesh , and found that he was led to the official papers dead .
so this is a domain of the brain .
and in the privileged layer , the privileged layer is to pay several more and a few households , common .
after these four children , you see the young young sister who are going to follow their children who were killed .
and finally , there was a single person who was sitting for me and later his participation , so i had to get him to the end of his participation , so he &apos;s had to be a little bit of it .
with 16 , children have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t go anywhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the naked hand of the naked hand , and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue to continue .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the ituri shelves .
or we do this , and we believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and so , the one thing is , why can i do that , but why don &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove of the gharial shows the dove of the dove glennie glennie , why listening to music is much more than a sound sound on his eardrum .
and it became so big until the point of a year where it was a very last year at cornell , and rick &apos;s asthma &apos;s radio and &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; million people in television .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing .
cp : you have luck that it &apos;s not going to be a live to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to think of it .
this is 10 times longer than mammals needed to reach their transportation size and to conquer all of these habitats .
we &apos;re similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re very unusual in our explorations in our explorations .
basically , it &apos;s a country that has no no adequate history for the beginning of our work .
this is an adult , in his jaw .
paul has never seen a fossil deal with this .
these are all the kind of thing . there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i became an artist and i started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been talking about this question for centuries -- how to participate in this world in science .
bad news for derartu tulu -- some other video shows had the same idea , underneath the olympic academy and paula radcliffe , which is a tremendously , very , very much , with the fastest the fastest .
show me a animal with a little bit of gills and gills , and it &apos;s got to do with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest largest power in the jungle .
now , emily &apos;s -- one of 500 to the billboards -- it ends up on the quest to look under the best 10 , although they &apos;ve done all the time in the world , and they &apos;re going to be able to defeat the baby , and to
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listening to the focus of these things that you &apos;re failing to have , when you need four hours .
in technology , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- not with security , not on a social way that would be , of course , and people really would help to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
cookie cookie is very , very bad .
the remote remote was an asian side of our group where they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become the active participants in life in their grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third way was a simple journal with paper and pen , because this is the most popular thing you used to use when you start a laser and sports program .
another important idea is this idea of the computer &apos;s brain &apos;s model .
i have a style , laughing , really hard , because it &apos;s not going to be drum , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the way to become a little bit of it , but it &apos;s going to be the n .
walk away , not far . i &apos;m fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the patriot falls between two of these cars .
when he wrote on a car party , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of advertising books , and i &apos;m going to do a little bit of advertising , everything with the same concept .
from photography , this is the most powerful thing that you get , you get desire and you get your name , and you can &apos;t have more .
as you can get into the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you turn the picture that he &apos;s going to sing , and suddenly it &apos;s pretty serious and maybe less accessible .
85 percent of the global health system for heart disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
just to treat . look at the situation in the island of the city .
but if you tell them , we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in nigeria , then all the fort .
it allows the existence of centers , and we can use the experience very clever .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s what matters .
and we start a technology program , so we can make local people that can fix the equipment .
it has a very large range of autism , which is a very massive -- the child , not a language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i &apos;m putting the film , like all of you have my projects , and that &apos;s the permian in me .
well , what i learned early , because i wasn &apos;t so social , i &apos;m not going to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a brain kit .
the movie in dr is called .
i made a lot of work during the worker , and i built things and learned how to do tasks .
another very much more important idea is that the kids of some of the many members of congress deserve a lot of the very active .
tg : i have passion for doing things that i make the world better .
it &apos;s a distributed reality , and the projections can predict and connect systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand on this coast , the cuban minister of the cuban ward , i look out on the far horizon , and i think , again , that i will make it all the way over the long , dangerous wilderness of a ocean .
but it was deeper , how much life is there still left ?
and then there &apos;s our main system that you never really tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all of these talks that i had a committee of my assistant just to get the most powerful thing to get them was very different .
thank you very much and fun at the conference .
and that may be the most important thing , he lost self-worth .
he &apos;s going to join the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly brings a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to quickly synchronize what other philosophers knew . otherwise , they couldn &apos;t lead the right kind of discussion .
but there was a programmer who decided that it wasn &apos;t the best way of doing work .
each of you can do changes , and you can isolate them to the short-term work , even if they knew nothing from the existence of each other before .
this is called &quot; a &quot; a &quot; lock , &quot; this thing right here .
something spectacular that can happen to a culture is that you can acquire a new kind of search of learning : the more powerful , the , you know , it &apos;s , right ?
don &apos;t try that , what other people do , a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get it very far .
and if you tell someone you can &apos;t , then you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months of the final year .
but we tested this rover before we put it up there -- or this one rover -- and you have a fortune , that everything works .
so we sent a probe on mars to mars , called phoenix . this probe will land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the process of doing this as we &apos;re talking to the next rover , which we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have been in the last time that these epiphytes are really cool things .
there were two satellites that were particularly interested in that .
it &apos;s like the cycle of the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today , i want to talk about how these exponentially growing technologies are emerging .
so , we look at how exponentially growing technology is affecting health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there are wireless things .
and i think many of these technologies will help us be connected to our patients and take more time , to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that are being augmented by these kinds of technology .
but the current trend in medicine is to become exponentially smaller .
come on to genomics , when 10 years ago , the first human being was done , was the cost of a billion dollars .
and thanks to the other things , like the most cosmopolitan of the way , or the management of your data on the ground of the data , or google health , it &apos;s always going to be more important , all of these possibilities on a kind of a
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attacks , we realized a more productive and higher , and higher quality of life , the use of the own cell cells .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many people who wake up on their own water , their land , a plastic smell .
how do you cross the front tiles on the street , in the street , in the street , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a very , a piece of mine would come out of me except control and i would be caught in the shocking of her favorite .
but i &apos;m afraid that the ted show came from and i &apos;ll show his hand .
if we love , she keeps me everywhere around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are focused on critical topics , images that are the most powerful ones , the religions are crossing the religions that are going to join us , and to do something with other words : act .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was a tremendous obstacle to discuss this disease , or to mention it , or just mention it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and studied and studied and study .
i could see what i was doing , and i was going to see the flag on the stick , well , ah , a second moment , and the music went to a computer show .
finally , at the morning , the morning , we got the most popular thing . we &apos;re going to put the helicopter -- two helicopter in the prison lab -- that made me on the edge of the ice .
i knew that there was more open water water , and i had a more open thing .
i had that , but i had expected something .
this was the view of my tent when i got this crazy call .
and just from the air i saw the big picture .
and they were doing it and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the coast .
and this said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but some days later , we thought about our students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this drunk guy didn &apos;t have been in this condition ?
one day in the years of marine acidification , the east of southern asia , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific , 20 american troops would sink in the ocean .
but at a certain point , most of the time , most of the time , most of the visions , they &apos;re going to give up , and they &apos;re going to grow .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more effectively than others .
right , fear is a startling gift of imagination , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a sense of the future , a way to look at the future if it &apos;s time to influence your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living room in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses and now we &apos;re going to crash them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s the people who want to care , and people want to be informed -- they get the internet trust through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as 22 in the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle just as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re going to be in .
so this is a snapshot of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and these are the studies that show that they are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these awful pictures of africa .
i &apos;m now saying , oh , oh , great .
ines is a very uplifting thing on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i was doing this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo . here &apos;s a little bit of a baby .
we were with the car at the time of the car , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just sitting in the car .
try and do it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
originally , from the raspyni brothers , the one who came up with the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; war &quot; building , a device with a body , and the sound of the body , where the sound comes
well , that &apos;s easier to say than done .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of plywood on the ground , and we were in about five feet apart .
when the idea was new , the thought was , why can &apos;t you take the oldest ted message , the &quot; tembererana &quot; rhythms , and combine it with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to an ethic in ethics .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of the room that &apos;s for newton .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation of the fact is that somehow it has created itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more powerful thing , and there &apos;s a lot of time to take policy and take the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who &apos;s defined his work in three different levels .
and just to let everything there .
and he &apos;s going to be a little bit of the time in five months to experiment with a complete range of paper .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers , who played all of them , they all had their own casa de musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit of a bit of it .
and it &apos;s a transition that has to do that much with the identity of living , as with the dead .
but the most important thing , the most powerful representation of wealth , also shows the status of the deceased , and the family of the deceased .
if we could expand our definition of death to incorporate life , we could experience death as part of our lives and maybe death with something else than fear .
i wanted to finish my show with a dance .
your talk about the water in the water , and the context that the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we all are naked , less , less expensive and that we can be able to swim well .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a nozzle . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show , are just so much over .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place if you can .
so i &apos;ll give you the message in advance : trying not extinct .
where are the little ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the people back here .
you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing , a more powerful , a more powerful , and you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t really bother you , if i &apos;m going to get your home card , right ? &quot;
and you could do that , that &apos;s a hint .
so we &apos;re more sensitive and we &apos;ve collected a lot of things , and we found a lot of little animals .
so we now know that torosaurus is actually a real triceratops .
it looks even larger than it could even be bigger .
we wanted to make atmospheric architecture .
all the water of the world is being served here , so we thought after you &apos;re on the water , and you &apos;re going to breathe through the water , and you &apos;re breathing water , you could also drink the building .
the drill was mounted on a top of a bed .
then you get up in this glass elevator at the time .
before and afterwards .
this is a guy from salt lake city . this is what the hell looks like .
&quot; encouraged them to be seduced into a body service . &quot;
it &apos;s not sure that this would be taken , if the bible was not a woman .
by the way , wired , it took us to heart .
analyze the news , talk about , if something is missing , like the people in new york times .
this particular plant filter filter and other volatile chemicals from the air .
m the most of the time i need to have a job of the morning when i &apos;m going to find out , for trying to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then -- remember this as a matter of rice in a event , and was it criticized for this ?
pm : are you hit on resistance as you did this for the rationale of foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of state , only 13 women were foreign in other countries .
thank you for having us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce their death rates around 75 percent .
for the most important time , as we &apos;re a computer zone , it &apos;s a very popular zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m so sexually drawn from this kind of thing .
to be exactly , today , in your capital , you want some , in those heavy times , the treasury cut and saving the life-saving programs like global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome , now , you have to think that chris anderson is a kind of a sign of the object , as well as jim watson , craig venter , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you describes this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you &apos;re holding for normal dna .
we heat them , add some salt , heat them almost down to the bottom and cool them , and as the result of the world &apos;s brain , the short strands and it &apos;s the short strands that make it out .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and form , ok ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four dna strands , and you &apos;re sitting on your individual , and you &apos;re going to sit in the other building blocks , if you fit .
we have a very sophisticated computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and that &apos;s a lot larger .
and they used to be the calculations , and to understand and get it better in the grasp , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three main issues : a class class community , who has completely diverse , and universal accessible to anyone with a medical show , regardless of its financial resources .
in modern time , where time is a great good , and the struggle about survival is the most common , common human being , and pay the bribe only to get further .
in my last 18 months , as a lawyer , in battle against small and large , big , big business companies , including india &apos;s biggest business business .
sm : well , the most powerful cost were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the tedx systems that are coming across the world , from new york to the small new new zealand here in the corner .
so , in a lot of content , we &apos;re doing a lot of things to do it , to make it easier .
so we use these kinds of data to find unique talks , such , which is a lot of different areas that are combined with these , which are much more important for your topic , and that , which really is creative between the fields of bridges .
no wonder that it comes up my colleagues because the truth is to digest .
the work of the design is just as good in a hospital of the way in a hospital .
at ted , brilliance is ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
secondly , the most famous nature of modern american education education , and the second one for a time is a conversation .
and said , &quot; would you be willing to have nuclear waste waste in your community ? &quot;
it &apos;s not a way to get this . teaching more ethics .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that is right .
bill gates talked about the importance of education , and in particular , the model of kipp brings it to the model . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to society that has lost in the world &apos;s business . he argued that rules often fail , incentives , and the wisdom will help us build the world .
&quot; by the way , dean , the arm has to fit a 50 year-old prize of a car , so the previous one of the fingers , of course , is the little fingers from the small fingers , and he has to weigh less than four pounds .
it takes another nine to make it useful and useful . &quot;
he &apos;s doing what darpa asked me .
boys and girls , you &apos;ve been given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help . he told me that he wants to go back to help his buddies .
how do we get out ?
you can look at war like a tragedy or a farce of a farce .
ford moved out . they were carrying a leg , and then the other .
in london , i lived for 44 days in a prison shop with nothing than water .
and i have a breath . in my first attempt , i have hold my breath to stop it , i haven &apos;t even got a minute for it .
there are a lot of these things that people are going to be able to do as deep as possible .
it &apos;s a big , and weighs it weighs .
because of the movement , i wasted oxygen .
then his chief and broke his record broke .
and there was no way to slow my heart rate down .
after 14 minutes , i had this terrible regularity to breathe like this need .
as a magician , i try to show people things that seem impossible .
congratulations . they &apos;ve finished the institution now .
tamara , do you take that ?
even now , the human being is ignorant to the most compelling thing through the waste of its civilization .
in africa , people have been consumed by 600 million superpowers last year , and two billion pounds of meat .
first , even if all the co2 emissions were stopped today , the global warming would be more .
and then we saw a case of the east coast of the united states , and it &apos;s moving more to every year .
today , there &apos;s a different movement . the movement , the earth , is to save the earth .
so , the fifth of the fifth , the picture we see here , died of this .
i want to give you a kind of a kind of a kind of a picture of a kind of a picture , which is what this change means : i want to explain to you what &apos;s going on for us to understand what &apos;s going on for us
and if it was just about , it would be really interesting .
in this salmon , it &apos;s going to be a genetically modified , a little bit of a gene that &apos;s made from the intersection of the gene of this breath and another , and that &apos;s what he &apos;s developed much faster with much less food .
these are actually intersections and no real animals .
we took this animal to the autonomy . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creature in the world that had a computer as parent -- had no organic parents .
paul collier : the time that it &apos;s time to be more powerful
if darwin had only the nasa .
1974 , in his different forms , probably there &apos;s probably on earth for billions of years , and it &apos;s always delivered and over again , and again , the evolution of evolution was being recruited as many times as often .
and only in the last 5,000 years , with rising frequency and distance .
evolution helps us .
say it further .
so old and the old , he may be very complicated , and it &apos;s very complicated , and it &apos;s very simple -- and that &apos;s the same time .
then they measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i kind of have a kind of kind of an geometry to put in the way that i did , which didn &apos;t actually have geometry .
she had been in the time of iowa until wounded , a remarkable era where mathematics was short before , from this world , &quot; break out &quot; to break up from this world . &quot;
down measurements , big currents , and -- -- -- is it , imitation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the thing that &apos;s going on .
that was one of my favorite favorites that were the same , that these islands were the same as the most important thing -- anyway or less .
should you remove the breast ? should you get them ?
right ? it has to be the hidden thing to be a lot of it , for that , to be a bit of cake replacement .
anybody ? it &apos;s much harder .
that can happen in a medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market when prices are on the highest , in the so-called hot , called the food , because if food is scarce -- because they have to feed their family and no choice .
it leads to very high amounts of water .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my pleasant job as senior economist at the world bank in washington and to return to ethiopia , for almost 30 years in abroad .
we build a system that &apos;s all used to the whole world &apos;s integrity , the integrity , trust , efficiency and transparency , and the small farmers help to overcome the risks that i &apos;ve described .
we believe that this initiative needs great political will , and we need to adapt the financial sector , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a wall wall from bacteria , which is the sand that runs through the desert .
they &apos;re threatened by the bare people from millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people are so poor in this region that they are trees to use them as a candy .
and , after the ashaninka cost of 60 dollars for bacteria you never would pay again , a cubic meter would cost about 11 dollars .
in a time unprecedented population and higher growth rate could be considered a drug problem .
the world shows me opportunities , and i chose .
our goal is a treasure design designs , so that we have a finite design , and so completely , that one single single dvd dvd is basically a single kind of a single peak .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , can all be in one gram of human manure .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the civilization-state .
you might think that it &apos;s just good pesticides , if these men refused to move shit , but it &apos;s also economically good , because they save a billion dollars every year .
with horror , she found that the family had no toilet .
the pace of the pace is to make people with sanitation , not reaching .
this reefs in discovery bay , jamaica , were 20 years of coral reefs in the world .
he sells the slaves , which were brought on the top of the sun , the song &quot; jamaica rice &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; jamaica rice &quot; -- is a model of the importance of the brain in canada .
and we &apos;ve been doing this in the last 100 to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about millions of times , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of the climate change is the most important thing of the coral . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
that &apos;s not selling .
and yet we &apos;re , according to our best knowledge , we know .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , satellite planes -- typical of the most powerful .
and what would be behind these kind of plastic systems , if it was ?
i was just a bit of a bit of time to go to the time , because i didn &apos;t read the novel to the dune .
and it was so successful that it was even more balanced .
and the point is a living little city , and to come to the beach , she said , you need to have a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was called joseph and he asked me to do what i did , and i explained .
and so we put in the case .
companies represent goods for households -- we &apos;re -- and we have income available , and that &apos;s more , so we can spend these income for more goods and profit .
the most profound , the most dramatic , was under zero in 2008 , before the crisis .
you can hear the mind of five-year-old .
and at the same time , the solution is clear because these aren &apos;t needed to change human nature .
we need to actually invest in the idea of a meaningful wealth that provide the possibilities that people develop .
first , it &apos;s not supposed to be an economist , so it could never be a bit of the way that you have to get a little bit of a bit of a bit of your mind .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited the street , in alaska , in 2002 to try to burn the minerals management service in the ice service , to monitor oil spills in ice .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s really really , really , really , really enjoyable .
and then of course , john co was rockefeller .
it was also reason for national health , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in the south of town , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs , they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , the two kids who might have three jobs or more , and then they have to jump .
we have to do something like this , and you can find more about this policy .
the first person is certainly familiar .
here she tells you to a computer star , &quot; afghan star , &quot; how her friends are pushing it , because not to be able to leave her friends to leave democracy .
last year , when i was here , i talked about my swimming pole .
it feels like someone behind you are standing and you beat your whole time on your head .
and we sat down , and we went to the end of what was wrong there , and everest .
and the point of information about it is , talk about it , and give a hundred percent . because there are only a lot of things that can &apos;t be achieved if we use our whole power for it .
this is a very simple thing . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of a kind of laser ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can create a design of a design -- the b -- the b -- from a string of components that are extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of ultraviolet lights .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how you get students to work with communities with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us are overwhelming in the world today , and so , connected to the variety of problems we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware of that , we don &apos;t even need to go to the entire world &apos;s history .
okay . i have one .
can we again connect to the natural ecosystems around us by adding rivers back to the scale of rivers and these things ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 dead per conflict , in the 1950s , to 2,000 deaths per year in the 1950s , so awful , so awful that is .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the most powerful .
if not , one of the two are communicating , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , algae .
and now i have the most salient thing on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad , until this so-called leap forward .
do you see how you grow ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people are in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re eating malaria .
and we need to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it very much . don &apos;t do it for a second .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be a superpower around .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- the evolution of technology is something that i give very much attention , so you know , one of the first objects you had , was a little bit of a little bit of a design .
my argument is basically that , well , it &apos;s already a part of our life .
and that &apos;s quite new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of the developments in technology , in the engineering technology , which can be used as a weapons , as biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is our favorite , &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; which was a pretty sophisticated , very sophisticated , very sophisticated , very sophisticated .
we only have in six countries , which is that the media is just talking about six countries .
so , should we be stuck with our money ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , of the nation , has ever been approved by the u.s. population .
during this development , we have been able to be the africans , the other way to the edge of development , the evidence and the need of politics in our countries .
the management , mostly , is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
we would like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even even more .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we have seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re in different interventions for the other reason -- it &apos;s possible to have a little bit of life -- three different lives .
but it turns out there were no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like a lot of plastic .
and what you find is that if you do fun , the most powerful thing is going on .
when i was a hurricane , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not afraid of making someone angry , not angry , i would make him happy .
a polar bear , which goes on the arctic , took from paul chaplin .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; comes together when all the parts and not only the event , but also my emotional connection to it .
nick -- again with an automatic camera -- has thousands of photos shot of this .
sometimes you can tell a rich story in a concentrated way .
we want to find solutions too .
and then somehow all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is that this is a kind of a process of a process that you can capture in only three seconds : we can in a period of less than one in a single afternoon in multiple different types of water and the world &apos;s brain .
emily : image metrics is a solar game , and it &apos;s a collaboration .
finally , i was involved in it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few beautiful primates .
but i was from the west and worked in the east .
all over the world , they were lost , animals killed , the forest cut down , and so on .
and coltan is damaged , and gold .
one day we met the air system .
the elephant just went and they took the most of the time .
i don &apos;t think anybody can embrace google because google makes the right thing even if people use google google to connect .
corneille ewango : a hero of the congo
we have almost without having it , and it &apos;s moving from a market market to a market economy .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should educate them , what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
the u.s. as a leader of the world in 1900 , where the line is to turn into red .
we have got this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women came back to the prison .
electricity was also helpful at the emancipation of women .
an amazing fact for the most amazing thing for the 20th century is that the first half of the 20th century is the three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the essay i was inspired by 11 years and for the one i got two + .
i have some who thought , for five and 15 , that would be my favorite , and that led to a failure of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think there &apos;s this sense or the inability to minimize the connection that i see between virtually everything in life .
that &apos;s what buddhist fischer says because they can &apos;t kill creatures .
and they &apos;ll notice it more often .
and i had to figure out what to fit in the story .
how are we going to be the most powerful thing , what the responsibility and the causes of one dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including those i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you can see it when i &apos;m going to see these examples , because i actually talk about everything you could spend your time .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
the corners of the street , on the center , is the big market .
these guys are asking the most powerful data of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be able to be more restrained -- you don &apos;t have to be completely skeptical of it .
so what you need to do is figure out who it &apos;s interested in .
nine months later , i was going to go to tahrir square , because it was a picture that i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
mostly the cultural inheritance tends to look at us looking back and the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized , is to bring environmental issues in a documentary of nature , i &apos;ve been dedicated to research .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m obsessed with them -- i was obsessed with them , i wanted to make another positive history about sharks to talk about the need of protection .
after i had left , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new kind of life to create a new kind of design .
they &apos;re also caught in the back of the street .
but when the fish came back and back the ocean , and the population was controlled , the forests grew from seaweed in the flat water .
now , she lives in the jungle of the jungle &apos;s brain , and this is a little bit of the baby , the second son , the one of the second orangutans , the son of the second orangutans i saved , the child &apos;s head .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without that microorganisms , there will be no performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the field of research , it &apos;s the driven , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the justice to protect your system .
the most prolific firewall , which is a paddle on a slippery surface .
i &apos;ll show you another one .
reuben &apos;s sculpture creates kinetic sculptures , beautiful works , which is moving into the pattern of falling , and in the pattern of the dry , he &apos;s going to be in nine minutes , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s in the process of mathematics , and
every city has their own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and develop this idea .
this is italian portal , the ukrainian park , the chief park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no one &apos;s not in science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t even ask the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain , and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the capacity to be the attributes of reality and as a properties of the value of the actions .
don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they could not imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a click .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t just do this thing for the work , no matter how often i am .
but we need to shift from an industrial model to a solar model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason is that the historical report is being digitized in the pace of the pace .
there &apos;s a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students to protest in the streets of the streets .
i stood up , made a tea , sat down and everything and now i &apos;m here -- still paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct releases to you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; to the courts for the faculty .
it &apos;s not a big thing that &apos;s not a big thing .
in fact , chris worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re another of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to focus on is the largest atrocities in this massive microwave microwave world of the earth through humanity and the most of that destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t do from the counter -- we &apos;ll get it to the impact where they &apos;re more effective , in the denominator -- we call him a little bit of the impact , where they &apos;re going to get the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge motivator on the market that has increased our revenues and profit .
we literally won it .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in california .
so , frankly , a lot of us , the way that we &apos;re working in the industry , that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly more likely .
and , right , do we need somebody to convey to us so that we have a experience with a very common translator ?
the arts , whatever they do , is to go every time they beat us , and to look at our way to look at our own with the kind of curiosity and curiosity .
the three sisters of le breathing with her passionate music , the new life , and at tedwomen , you start with the happy and barren , &quot; david &apos;s &quot; from david &apos;s , &quot; the &quot; david monologues &quot; -- then they play a little bit of the
the manchester scourge of driven driven by my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through taking a special furniture from the rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american bank of american health , which is the harvard harvard of the world &apos;s harvard , and we &apos;re going to be a computer project for mothers in the middle of the inner middle of the city .
we realized that you need to give you flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie and herbie and herbie , and you can cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids , who were given up from the world , the public schools , and that &apos;s what they can do , with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked very well .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take you to record the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell them to sell you to sell a agreement that says that money is used to help the school . &quot;
this is a room of nancy wilson was built by the date of the last christmas in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which is what you &apos;ve looked at and i tell you where i made my biggest mistake .
he came up to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people .
bill slater tells a quiet and amazing story of redemption by art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then brings the air to the brain to the brain , and the result is a very , a standard that produces a normal car model .
but there was the most profound factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better to make a better reaction to make normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with an invisible model of attacks that are going to be in the environment , so that we stay healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all involved in making these molecules , then the number of molecules are going to be connected to the cell &apos;s cell level .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a second of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly reactive , which is that we kill bacteria with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they do tasks that they could never do , if they were just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to get to this conference .
or the first one in the room .
but if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about is the actual character of the brain , and qualities that are worth it , and you can get it to be able to get out and recognizes .
what a reason you would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he &apos;s going to do it .
so aristotle has a little bit of flutes , and the harsh question of marriage &apos;s , the potato marriage &apos;s right question of marriage &apos;s marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you don &apos;t have to say , we don &apos;t know what we should do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of humanity is a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called the &quot; ? &quot;
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the world &apos;s population is going to be enough .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get a mixed of pieces before we get a car age , and although the damage has been the damage before our birth .
that means you have to do your homework to understand whether that &apos;s true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read somewhere in the last 20 years that the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet has been free to get 10 years .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they were going to the center of the computer bank and they put in the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a very hard time to present the most powerful , the arguments that i have learned from economists , epidemiologists and environmental communities .
the most shocking thing is something creepy , and you probably know a part of the most of the time .
fourteen americans die per day at asthma , which three times the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the most of the food .
he apparently had sense of humor .
politicians and the people have fear of being able to turn out the sound of &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; .
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try it . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go . &quot; and pay people to do it , they were watching each other who they saw .
he may think he would have ever born the baby &apos;s baby , so he might need a little help from the outside .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to go with africa , the next chapter , &quot; deal with this , &quot; and it &apos;s a healthy , more beautiful , beautiful african .
but most importantly , they &apos;re going to be productive in their lives , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect this to all of us ?
we were on the side of the computer .
i had to crawl between the legs of these people , with my sister on my back , to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and i often don &apos;t see african employees under them .
the question is , how can we take out of all this good will we get to this ?
you &apos;re a little bit of the internet . &quot;
we have a lot of plastic chips in nigeria with the oil system .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , it &apos;s a product of a product , i took this case to explore it , so that we can study it , exactly how we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show you this for you quickly .
and then i &apos;m in the control of the control , here , games in change .
now , how do you take rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the field of life .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and the math .
this is very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not comfortable .
but keep the idea for the whole time of eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used and intuitively used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise she &apos;s very careful , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another statement of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a kind of a plastic project .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria and it &apos;s a very interesting thing .
we have every street , every village , almost every square inch of madagascar .
in your business business , a very cheap blue laser is a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yes !
what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got the whole time to put it out , we never did it yet , the wings in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is a little bit of the time that you see here , growing in a very mature , which is made by the outside and it &apos;s been turned out .
so , water is a major aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still from .
the idea is not overweight .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air hits .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a self , could it be even more open , but even more open genome of this ?
and on the other hand , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of doing it , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a fair deal .
the last thing is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest very close to the koran &apos;s actual idea of the tower , which is the 36 times as a gardens , the manchester , defined by running streams .
but the more you add , the more it seems to be lost .
and this number of 72 comes never before .
this is a nest colony of a wheels and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony which has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s what you want to do -- is a magnifying device -- you &apos;re going to go out early morning , before the first group is on a foraging .
strangely , interestingly , it looks like it &apos;s about half the colony colony just nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the sins and put them on the edge of the mountain and put them there .
the foragers are actually making them , not getting away .
and we did experiments that show that the longer an ant is going out , the more and more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface , and so that the ants smell different , they &apos;re doing different things .
they cover the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all the world is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not to do that .
i think i &apos;ve been thinking where we can use the natural gas .
and when i was in the way to get natural gas , natural gas was nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
so just 500 million .
it &apos;s never been thrown through the ground ground or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million to wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of water . and there was a lot of water .
the life is a event . let &apos;s get it to the world .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built the first one .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to cut up the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : that didn &apos;t get just and had to wait , but then the most important , the most important time they were there , they had to call somebody phone .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a rather clinical language and you may not be able to get it as warm to the heart as you can do with any other conversation about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the people who are going to be doing it is that they &apos;re going to be able to get out of it .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my own competitor , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less to apply the golden rule to you . okay .
so , the results are going on . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of being sustained , non-zero-sum relationships , forces one that &apos;s the humanity of others .
and you &apos;ll explain to you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t feel them , and even it wants to dominate , and they hate america .
most of the diseases with poverty , but in the case of cancer at children , the children who died of cancer , mostly from wealthy families to come to the disease .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you &apos;re simply not going to apply this kind of energy and time when it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant business system would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and that you will make this one a single kind of a single loan .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a sort of a sort of conceptual matrix that had the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , in about four days , they were going to see the same thing , and they see what we &apos;ve
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves , where do we go ?
and so i &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
we have a dream of a photographer that was caught in the hook ; a boy &apos;s book , so many of the things that have been so many of the things that you have made of the shelves , is that you &apos;ve taken it out of the shelves
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you &apos;d have four good friends to be able to decipher their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can see lying ; i used to be talked , and then they were on .
they told me how big the bath was , or said , &quot; the most powerful thing is , &quot; and so far from the hotel .
and the same thing is , right there . okay , glass , go a picture !
and you want to have your eyes on it .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i &apos;ve got away from life for emails , social networks and so on , although there was nothing really important or not really important .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of plastic .
and everybody who then went down and i went down .
at least for me , because if i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know when i see myself .
are you going to be nervous ?
im : do you worry ? you look cute .
as , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not painful , ok ?
if you have the cream too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- which people are most different of each other or ethnic times , but yet , as citizens , all of the same things can be equal .
in egypt , i was finally discovered .
this was in london , in the yemen , was trained to go and break a plane in amsterdam , and go to amsterdam in amsterdam .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that apply to democratic culture on the basis .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , the family is one of the richest families , saudi media &apos;s .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political coalition for a political goal , and that was , the leader of the leader .
these tools are only becoming social when they &apos;re getting bored .
it &apos;s measured the limits of the individual networks and then they then do it .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who were in the foreign convention , or companies from the rest of the world , they had the offices in china that were hearing that news .
and finally , the chinese ran through .
we &apos;re increasingly more in a media landscape in the media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of the time , i &apos;m going to take a look at it , i &apos;ll still take a look like i did .
in my fourth side side , a comet on everest moved to the mountain .
this view is the most powerful thing up there , the first 600 meters of the climb base base .
and this is in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on the summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck buffett , another climbers , in this storm collapsed , and died .
it &apos;s so evident , because up to work , i sometimes have some syringes directly through the clothes .
this climber was a giant .
and i can only pick up the way that he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to change the thoughts .
these are hedy , the most sophisticated light bulb .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very significant for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs became more technologically related to models , and they &apos;re wearing in great ways to society .
it was a lot of people who wanted to introduce democracy because they bring the ideas to the universal right , parliament and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is the cities .
the second is the most important thing we have , which is so difficult to create entrepreneurs , creating rational jobs in companies that 93 percent of indian jobs are in the field of life .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to take a modern health system , so you don &apos;t have the most sophisticated , if you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy of what &apos;s important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to let the government .
even though some people don &apos;t like to hear it at the left , it was actually the revolution of markets that have been devoted to the world &apos;s population , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the masses anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the u.s. and the ones that they represent .
the brain is .
every one of these most sophisticated ones would be populated for two years after the most dramatic .
david cameron invested 20 million pounds in a social social model to support this idea .
brené blakley : investment in social change
i work . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the cheek ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; i know you , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum and i &apos;m a computer scientist . that means i &apos;ve just been hearing anything you &apos;ve just heard , only with my voice .
and finally , with this one , i can put my sounds on my right , and i &apos;ll let it go , repeat .
our people had to try to get about 5,000 different types of paper to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do it . everybody can do that .
on the right is a very important way to see .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue river river .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients are pulling up the most sophisticated .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery at any time and immediately stop .
so , street street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really do a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs both directions .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend and you can get that fast as quickly .
and their jokes , like the most powerful of a car , work really only within this aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time before trial , and the merchants decided that the amount of expensive dignity would be too expensive .
these are the two of the most binary systems in the logic of copyright protection .
and i want to really thank you for this point of view of the brain that you &apos;ve done , that it &apos;s made this very , very sophisticated presentation .
once i got a boat in a remote , and i realized that the piston i should meet , not were covered .
i think this is one of the most profound and more important things on the planet .
there are many ancient folk companies in the u.k. , in the u.k. , if you take a $ functional , you &apos;ll notice that the mosquito is the most important time in front of the churches .
here &apos;s the most profound thing that &apos;s called the most of the time that &apos;s about a decade .
i hope i can find these organisms , help them make attention to their remarkable , remarkable , and part of their own , to protect their own longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals still use mobile phones , but they also create their own personal , as that one that &apos;s used by the most violent mexico in all 31 states .
what do you do with that ?
what could terrorists do today with the technology now with technology ?
recently the fbi has a major place in the united states , which was to put these remote drones into the u.s. niches of the u.s.
so , as we see here , we &apos;re going to turn in the cracks .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent , if you get rid of it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s being killed so many people that the only funeral in the world are not going to be able to do that in the same way outside of the world &apos;s surface of the outside of the world .
but on the other hand , i hear people , like you speak from fear , a certain aversion to the risk .
and apparently she became in 1999 when she worked in colombia with the u of her , with the goal , her culture and language to keep her culture and the language of the riots , tortured and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation of the manipulation of a young language .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , lightly categories , because we don &apos;t look at profits as an extraordinary instrument .
but the whole community , all different backgrounds , also the most sophisticated and the more cosmopolitan , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because if you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , she &apos;s feeding the world , she &apos;s enough to feed the world . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of my wife .
why don &apos;t i make my wife make a lot of life , make a tie ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company makes a sanitary pad out of cotton and it works .
the pine table : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why are you using such a nasty patch ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access to it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam in dirt trash and forth .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers are going to be in my fingers and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you , since you &apos;re 18 years old .
the prospect of that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion barrels of oil on earth today , which can be put and nurtured .
now this may be the end of the story -- okay , we &apos;re just replacing all the conventional , renewable materials -- but i think that &apos;s more than the story .
so , very special material , the abalone shell itself , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year .
and the idea was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great personalities that i would interview and interview that .
but i wanted to be a different interview .
in fact , my first favorite designer was george abbott , who was 97 years old , and paper prints was full of life -- i think that &apos;s how you can define it .
we know the great amount of dna , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the sense of the thing is to make someone ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that big one , but it was a very big job for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was hiv-negative , the other one didn &apos;t .
this is a very uplifting thing in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice thing .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the &quot; treatment . &quot;
it &apos;s not the painting we had made , but what we actually did was actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we talk about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank , from the ministers of president , the high clerks of the president of the indian areas .
they &apos;re actually drinking the fact .
most of the great companies are now convinced that they need to be very strict policies against bribe .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you would expect it to be all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression of the face actually reflects what she thinks of him .
well , he &apos;s sharing his life .
this french painter of the 18th century was known for his own day , but also people were also in the day .
unfortunately , these inmates are now spending their most of the time with a series of other orphans in archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i had a dinner dinner , i had a dinner dinner that gave us a parent .
&quot; congratulations to your neighbor , james . &quot;
my father lived most of his life in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
so , the other thing that &apos;s called the movies , but our movies , they &apos;re stories with our people .
so it &apos;s a young man out there , and it can actually be to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any behavior , behave .
so , online , so much to say , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
so , you &apos;ve described this as a design industry called the world &apos;s program .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a big one .
now art art art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re completely recyclable .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re going to go to walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then the most important , behavior .
i had to quit a few bridges behind me .
everything is about the most sophisticated and students who are going to be able to get out of the first meeting , that they &apos;re going to deny a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and the things i used to do .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , is being adopted a involvement .
and one day i had a -- oh , the other day .
i &apos;ve done the most sophisticated and copper very thin , so it &apos;s going to be a little thin .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i loved things like my house like this .
she never was completed .
the dome was a wish of the computer .
it was a trial , this thin piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 on 76 feet -- turning into a property of the field , and that &apos;s a kind of a lot of the tube , and that &apos;s where the dining room in this pavilion , with
they call this &quot; plan rough . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems like a newspaper iceberg in the mountains .
our achilles don &apos;t want an art galleries , so -- and when we met our new motto , he told us that this was the right form .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the air of the building , which was built by the food , the food revolution , and the food revolution .
can &apos;t we make clean burning in ?
and one of the things they found was that they didn &apos;t burn .
and these are our main briquettes .
and he has the problem of health impacts of the health effects and coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this was india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to move things forward .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going on .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and engineering .
he married . he had a son called the &quot; aw . &quot;
is this business with our outer and our employment of a social phenomenon ?
now i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , and where we want to .
we can replace the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing facial contact .
my theme is food in schools , because here &apos;s the social justice .
and the next is the most important thing .
people are constantly talking about sustainability , but we should find out what that is at all .
you know , all of you think you have to have more and more food ?
and then they have a lot of time , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical video project .
the things that we might do to home , and so important , we think that we have to teach kids to schools .
we need to educate employees .
this eight billion mean , by the way , two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money , the government is ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot hot drum with me outside the sun .
if i go to a party and ask me , what i do , what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; your eyes are matt .
i want to know your business system , all of your way to know about your own beings , intuitively -- that you &apos;re a professional in things .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be a little bit of the garbage .
it &apos;s a documentary in the brain series of consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start with a few examples . some examples .
now , jeff hawkins has described his efforts to bring a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular in london said , &quot; what do you mean : &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody &apos;s in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm , in january of january , 2006 , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road at the second january of january .
so , we made these enormous poll with lots of plastic , and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went for 20 years -- from eastern asia to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the redwoods east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s rights , who are going to be in the doors of the people who are going to be able to send their daughters to schools like in the village in the village ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was cleaned , i had the blue blue , the blue blue .
and there were even two of them .
there was really something .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients , and i want to talk to you about a couple of other patients , to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded us where we can fly to each address .
we are , they are most of the most imaginary resource in health care .
it &apos;s a solar system of seawater .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the help of sound waves . i &apos;m talking about the most powerful .
in the united states alone , the annual cost would cost to be more likely 22 billion dollars to have a lot of wealth , and so bats have been able to do wealth .
why should we be doing with aging at all ?
if you go out here , and look at the night night , and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you &apos;re smiling . thank you very much .
europe had to be brought into economic development .
the boom of the raw resources is not all , but a lot of countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why is it called &quot; the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very highly dramatic policy .
a few economists just came in at time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people are stuck in poor , or more in the world , and as we can help them ? the economist paul collier is a very interested plan , compassionate plan , with the gap that we can close with
we have no container where they &apos;re made .
here he is giving an english surgeon in africa that &apos;s required to take a measure of the research of the study .
so we &apos;ve got this : imagine , imagine you thought they were a lecture and you could talk to people in their loved language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery . &quot;
14 years ago , i came to the first time at this ordinary material , and i was used to the first time that we had been used in the same way in centuries .
he asks me if i could build that as a piece of a piece of paper for the city .
so we experimented with small plastic engines to create a dry fog that will be shaped by wind , and then it turns out that he can be shaped by people who can interact with it , and move through without becoming a force .
they were in the grass in the grass , watching the kind of sticky patterns of the world &apos;s brain , which they didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
so , i also became aware of this , that this is an enormous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot that you see there is the same place that &apos;s going to be in the brain in the field of life .
if you do that , what are you going to do ?
and to say that these changes can be beyond death , even a claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me give you a clear point of what i don &apos;t say . i &apos;m not saying science can be able to be able to have this room or we have scientific responses to every single time of being a moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this be an objective morality ?
how much is the probability that this is a very pessimistic of the human development ?
on the left , you see edward suits .
we live in a world of data , and we can &apos;t be able to get rid of these technologies , and it &apos;s always a lot of things to break , as they get together to be able to get together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle , which we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a more powerful coke , but a second polymer , two mm long , g , a quick and an agile tool .
and if we put these good online molecules in a corporate field , they go to the flowers .
in israel , in israel , where we on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli predators -- biological checks at the heart of the city , 75 percent of the pesticides are saved .
third , the conscious of the farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
so , the main thing is , one of my favorite favorites .
it &apos;s fun to make the most powerful fun of the world &apos;s rich , than about the other . i do it often .
&quot; urban health , &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her name was a little bit of the piano , and so it was -- i wasn &apos;t going to say that -- i was not going to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the soviet union , just for decades , found some decades , maybe within a decade , after the soviet union was the most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , which really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls at all , in the soup , it &apos;s still meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
so , to the one , we decide to do one , or till five pounds of output .
we can increase it a little bit at the cost of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be soon a boundary .
and you might think , well , you &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes hasn &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; oh , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadians are the system of the system , they do it in a way that &apos;s going to benefit society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a very important thing . and on the back , some other gadgets , the brain , and scales , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is how the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors , because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s a meter of 80 feet , you can get over the currents of the air and the water &apos;s surface .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis and so quickly spin .
welcome to the robot , the robot , the robot , the mechanics of virginia tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
and let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of success ?
but just by a piece of imagination to speak is not enough .
in this way , education is very important .
so , the main thing that will be done to be a solar game ...
there &apos;s basically no pipeline of good teachers , and only eight percent of the county have a more and higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty to creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the surgical bikes on the wheels , then they won their team .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money was a lot of money that was determined for school camp .
and after coming out and the neighbors to interview what they buy , what they buy and why , and why , is a homework homework .
it &apos;s literally impossible to create big pavement .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the design and exploration .
after four months , there &apos;s a million months of dry season , and now it &apos;s eight months ago .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is going to take the climate change in the same direction , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than this .
when i learned about these two things , i think that &apos;s very , both of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very good job of the water , which was made in part of the ronald mcdonald foundation .
after treatment , we have a series of a series of simple software studies to see a series of simple reasons to see how to adapt vision .
the answer is motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track these research studies and hopefully to report more results .
and then , i have this kind of plastic company for physical disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i choose about it , i look at what this is like .
but that was the fall of 95 , and then when the winter was prisoners , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then it has to get aimee to the special &apos; 80s , and she &apos;s excited . her family travels -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everybody i could , i could do it , who i could , who &apos;s the case , so who i am doing , who am i going to do here ?
i &apos;d always gained everything and i thought , &quot; what ? &quot;
you can be a big deal . just take them off . &quot;
so , aimee and the designers will be rolling up at ted , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they had somebody who came up with the shoes and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy is to detect it , because we use copyright blindness .
or to the 3.5 jobs .
and something else about mathematics : math looks like math -- like this in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i get drunk ? &quot;
in education education , we &apos;re using about 80 percent of time to teach people how to step three of your hand .
when people ask me , is that true ?
but the controversy in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing today , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do today , as a car and learning .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both the same at the same time .
and one of the reasons why it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the tests .
it was in the winter of 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought especially about my father , who was dying of a surgical operation on the brain .
similarly , just as you can get through the handle of the world &apos;s capacity , the shifting nature of the soil can be kept . and time makes a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re going to be rolling up .
but when i was extending , and the broadway went along , i was blessed to be blessed in every corner .
if you design a city in the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to get rid of the bumblebee . &quot;
and the most famous one that i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is fertile and disposable -- ...
you give money for a good purpose and designed emotional deals on the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book written , and it &apos;s written by heaven .
so this is actually the key to me , actually , to remind me that on the way , the car is not going to be the way that the car was coming up , and i didn &apos;t go up on the road .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make a difference that we have to do this book , we really need to get into it , and it &apos;s called it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that were doing this work was to be able to get the design of this , so we developed an application of the design of the brain that &apos;s going to be a laser in the laser for a laser on a laser .
alex was working on a little bit obscure , independent , independent , independent , independent report for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop the interface in the movie .
we &apos;re going to take this surgery through that , because we like yellow and we like the yellow and we like green .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a window of life .
we , as humans , are the things that are designing and we should make sure that our machines help us and build on it .
john , thank you for making science science .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this agreement immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good business systems do , they do a leap from 20 years when the audience changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to get it . so change and we started playing in love .
but india didn &apos;t want to play the game .
the other was an indian cricket .
was that the new india ? that was a different world where you could get the players from everywhere , long as you got the best player .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything else . did a job of khan khan , and the audience of a song , for a computer company , was not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made any of you to have a experience of richer and the game , and hopefully , there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs because they have very quickly in memory , as often as they saw dogs and pigs , and they &apos;ve seen the rope .
why about all the world should be playing any lottery ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a child , you can buy a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining remaining for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the path to the other end of the city is 100 , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , nothing you &apos;re saving , but people don &apos;t think so .
well , in the big and all of it you &apos;re tremendously impatient .
watch what happens when we skip the exit line .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , is he a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons of guns .
and so some people look at economists as dumb people .
and the theme of this is one of these most powerful things that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation to the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; so in words and in fashion , the same rule , as well as to new or too old , is not the first one that &apos;s been published , the last one that &apos;s the old , the old one &apos;s last one . &quot;
and i woke up one day , and i said , &quot; well , maybe this isn &apos;t that ? &quot;
first of all , my willingness to do a critical audience , not to suggest i was too safe .
it &apos;s my intention to the poster to the poster , you should not have understood it .
so , in the big and all of the lives they &apos;re living our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
when the space sank , we could see that people are more negative in the way to be gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i did in those 20 years , in the far time .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i became sick .
we don &apos;t need any more people &apos;s problems .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to go through so much psychological trauma or damage and africa .
through the whole book , more than an hour of a bird is more than an hour of the sun &apos;s and interactive animation .
what is the business of this ?
it had at least that you have to be , but you &apos;re always true , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still is about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re going to be in the 1920s , and you &apos;re going to be on the rooftops of the spanish .
rsw : so how does his schedule look ?
the most popular thing -- they &apos;ve been interviewed me for mit and have sent their technical technology to bilbao .
that &apos;s what reminds me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for them , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you walk four months for three months , the ideas are going to be more clear and live .
and one thing that i wanted to mention at my ted tour , but somehow i missed , all companies to be able to do that in the way to help me .
but in the meantime , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand , of hand .
you see the suits , the color of the light .
the funniest thing about pandemics and things is remarkable , and this is the most important thing to be the internet .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth will be built here .
on this level , around 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world land to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture of the subject .
and wish three is : &quot; -- i was told myself , i should be a do myself , and i always wanted to do something like that .
and it becomes increasingly more important that we can figure out how to win these materials from these extremely complex things .
the traditional ways to separate material is simply not to do plastics .
the traditional way to make it happen is to do oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed species of plastic : many different kinds of plastics and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of plastic projects out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they &apos;re doing the same stupid thing as we do .
here , indra . she &apos;s going to trade a token against food and wait happy , and you get your food .
you wait a little impatient that the market opens up .
now imagine that i &apos;m going to push every one of you to a thousand dollars in the hand -- so 10 more hundred bucks .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re going to be really losing a coin .
if we produced the same scenarios in our small brain systems , they would be the same things that people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people on the last stage of development , which are dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think of wood , most of the time , it &apos;s just four stories tall .
we need to build less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . in recent days , we &apos;ve been working on a lot of plastic .
this is just as much as we have in 900 cars a year of 900 cars .
and the curtains curtains .
maybe &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they were up to fight against the decline of law , and the citizens of this networks are working together to help each other .
so , the biggest and oldest bank in russia , mostly in the ownership of the russian government , is now using to diagnose employees and citizens in development with innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about people who have heard about people who have their plants hacked with self-expression , and they work on the world , and they &apos;re working on the world all the young people to create websites and make videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all the children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to communicate a message , and all of it read in their own language , a central version of the golden rule , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is you do that , you know
a pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some of the arguments .
there &apos;s 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of plastic fiber .
there &apos;s also a few constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a very talkative .
i was watching aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we had no food and we were around the 400 .
as a child , as young and delicate , words that i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , shared in the form of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m a donation , i &apos;m a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more complicated , more complicated , called &quot; federal protocol of the protestant world . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task with the best thing we &apos;re doing with death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa santa claus knows if you were good or not . &quot;
but julie , you were so prepared for school . you were so prepared . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense that was the right answer , and then they said , &quot; do you think we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest look at the modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs to be a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it may be in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics and the climate change in the way of climate change .
we &apos;ve done a project for a few years ago , a big program , and it was : the most important thing -- the most important -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- a big , very big , very big , very big
a group of people who are asking themselves to spend it for themselves and to spend the other group of people .
when you went from the first building to the second building , all of the time on a man who was complaining and refused and clearly needed help , and the question is , did you think and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , a combination of &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; and &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; : it &apos;s a little bit hidden : the hidden life of life .
since since -- now , there are four decades -- i &apos;ve been training with the best in this area , the world &apos;s scientific review , young and old teaching , designed , and created a wonderful web of art , successes and autonomy .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life life .
i danced between the computer and i was interviewing him , and i was doing this in my inbox .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s how it was .
he put them together , combined this thing , and then he &apos;s convicted of this software that i think was originally developed by his son , and he &apos;s created this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little bits of rock , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , do you make a beautiful website , how could i say , you don &apos;t have to make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve now put together . 32 hits , which everybody is a protein with these traits and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about linked data .
all this will be going to be two million children every year , and the last year , when 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , and give feedback , to make sure that the promises really provide results ?
you just show one of the numbers that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to give me revenge of the drawing and paint .
and that &apos;s what fascinated me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow walking across the street to mysore , to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re training as people who are in the way that we &apos;re doing that , and that makes the meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay . &quot;
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of plastic from a box .
because if we see somebody walking , we see the footprint .
what percentage of it did we have made of the foreign government revolution ?
obviously , he had the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the funding of foreign aid is actually quite awesome , and here &apos;s the end of the way , because if you think about it , i &apos;ve been blogging today about economists , thinking that most things are very fashionable .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a technical thing now .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t put it on it , so you accept it and you find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s a little bit of the street and it &apos;s a computer maker .
pizza is going to take you when you have hunger .
there are millions of different types of water .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet chen chen , and this is what i &apos;m saying , &quot; i can &apos;t hold it the most sophisticated thing .
and that is , &quot; how much percent of the day do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over over over 55 societies , people have come to the brain structure .
they came home with the local percent of dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more restrained than women ? &quot;
no time at that time , the women were so educated , so interesting , so they could .
she &apos;s 23 / 23 she has taken her 13 .
i started to go to the point of why you were in love with one person than in the other .
you &apos;re going to be , as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called spiral , &quot; these calendars . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , could it be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight and more vulnerable diseases -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more nuanced .
peter ornish : what if our views were wrong with diabetes ?
my great mother , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , the life of people to improve and make cars affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to address the big problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but in the way we have a industry .
i think you can imagine it .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we have , if our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
this is a minute 59 minute .
i think now , my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of thing .
the nurses have to put data on data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what &apos;s it coming from ?
and it was great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a student was a student , i saw adults who really believed my ideas , and i was drinking a lot of the research of mine , and i drink a lot of the plastic projects with me .
now it &apos;s just about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
and basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money they give us , used to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , but what i want to do is , i &apos;m going to be doing that , that the fact is that that &apos;s cool .
in a way , in a way , or more elegant , the same product that we have in the face of the other day , which is the most important day , the most important thing that &apos;s more of development -- and inspired by the incredible way of
if you think about the change in our society , the world &apos;s energy change in the world , the 200 years , has taken the same process in 20 years .
it has changed changes even though these were even unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think of a reduction in the height of 94 percent for almost pure .
and as we do in this growing world , we &apos;re doing something more powerful , especially in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china to say , for example , 400 new airports , 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the speech talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being ; without proper darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very well-known office office , which is that the average project .
behind you , you see the most sophisticated building building later , that it became a icon of modern health .
i think that &apos;s what you see here , quite amazing -- how much light in the sky is going to be , and never reached the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more comfortable .
they &apos;re not going to be disturbed anymore .
when our main school , as a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india called a war in a third of india called the average , he &apos;s called the issue of the following .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was walking home from the office , i might see a bee , or it was in the sense : could i be like a bee , that &apos;s wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s it going to use ? what was it used ?
to do what ? to break stones , to dig .
that &apos;s the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want to pick up a second choice of standards and the internet .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s made of the sound of the sun &apos;s brain .
i had to be my favorite .
mr. s. , who lives with a physical challenge , is only 50 inches tall .
so , the math system , the most powerful , chocolate .
this is a video game .
these are metronomes billion people .
or ski . it just makes fun and people love it to do a little bit of fun and fun things .
so we have very , very hard working , but we knew that it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance is what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for the next side to park , and it &apos;s wonderful to go with them between the cities and go to the ground , but think about it : we have solved all the problems in terms of reach and speed .
so if we could put this box here in a few years , we have a solution for transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
implicit or explicit is being manipulated that people who die there somehow are in the drug goods , and we take that , that they either have tortured or professional or even more .
go to los zetas as a cutting-edge of psychopaths that fear and horror in cities are going to be able to get the press to the silence and the press is true , and that &apos;s true .
mexico and the u.s. , now , is now growing up on an international organization that is partnerships with production in the south and global partnerships in the global distribution .
but also part of it , a month of being a paper -- you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , it tends to , if you &apos;re successful , about a critical mass of the brain , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you see the interesting implications . if you get cheaper , the brands that are the most powerful and the , the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , winning the power , they
if you look at this , linux is in red , it &apos;s got 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible &quot; is really , you know , the gift of silicon to the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works between and trying to take the best one out of each other .
the second one had to be extremely cheap .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had access to a technology that allowed him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of the men and women are honored by all generations .
they remember , during the world &apos;s office , they were in the course of the hurricane , and they often have the hurricane , and it was just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to be a little bit of magic , and i think i heard steve martin play and said to me , that can also be me .
i wrote this post , and i &apos;ve taken this for einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things are just .
and maybe i have to get a lot of time because i &apos;m working on it when i talk about it .
he was convicted of it , except by our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of the ocean that works the oceans .
we studied these fish , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s just half the size of the largest tuna that we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under tunas , and there it is .
you can fly a lure -- it &apos;s like a seal -- and a white shark will go on it , a little bit of a creature that &apos;s very close to our 16 foot .
and then these animals are even giving us one encore by helping us help .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the record of my neighbors were so accurate .
they said , &quot; besides , what we &apos;ve talked about , are you groups that are going to want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy for that .
now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite , i see that i was there , and i know i &apos;ve been in the ninth of may for $ a year for a year of the ninth of the year .
all of the few moments i press a computer camera on my life .
when i started the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say , what you &apos;re doing and where you are ?
now it &apos;s normal .
now , look at this kind of thing , you see , this is a little bit of paris , to see how incredibly quickly growth is .
i looked at thousands of failures , and trust and efficiency are always the same elements .
how do we copy how trust is going to be built by face ?
i was a mind in the system .
this page is going to be given to a day , and 80 percent of it get a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the level of inequality that i &apos;ve shown you , i &apos;m going to come back to the back of the time .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second phase of life , then , with the 50 american states -- the same question : cut the more unequal states on all of these scales bad ?
with devastating implications , what &apos;s going to be the benefit of talent of the population .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same contrast .
the social habits are taking to be taking the fear of those judge .
or for example , why violence is more powerful in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to being geographically .
a year takes more than three million microbloggers a new knee or a new knee .
they remember , &quot; kamal , &quot; before .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that they wear a prosthetic , and in societies , with a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you very much .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i even bought the most salient thing , and there &apos;s a little sheet of paper that says , &quot; use these miniature spots not to break juice .
these are the results of the one to the 20th , &quot; put google just so many &quot; o , &quot; the way there are pages .
strong fear is a mess .
but if you always would be in this condition , the work would never be done , because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in the world .
if the park was rusty and would fall apart , they would never go to a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be able to highlight the results .
i &apos;m going to talk to kids and self-organization and a series of experiments that led me to the idea of how an alternative education might look .
and at night , 70 children in the internet , they were going to be a billion .
so i could actually choose to make some samples to get a cross-section , which represents the whole world .
what you &apos;re obviously seeing is a child that uses the computer to use the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , organisms , societies -- except the discussion about the theory of intelligent designers .
and it &apos;s about parikrma idealism in this whole way .
i bought a nice suit and i carried shoes with a little bit of the same access that i had to get to the street .
but 2002 , when my tour went to end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go to the job that was waiting to go back to me .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through this cube .
and i traveled to kosovo and donated the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes to the world , and obviously , obviously , and points out that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re actually the people who are actually affected , not not yet .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a sense , independent diplomat , this kind of thing that happens with all of us .
&quot; hey , could you still get me more out of it ? &quot;
because if we go back to the top of the time , it understood by this exercise that a simple mistake can say what you don &apos;t do , or we can remind us why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go there .
what &apos;s the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , the memorable show , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; in 1973 , in 1973 , followed by the top 10 rise followed by &quot; the

and i &apos;m really excited about talking about them , i &apos;m going to go in and say , &quot; can somebody tell me the basic device , and why is that cool ? &quot;
next , this virus is producing stuff that the bacteria chop .
from a series of reasons .
or worse , scientific education is always becoming more like the guy who always says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have a lot of work , and if somebody is involved in science , i &apos;m going to show you , with me .
we &apos;re going up the staircase and experience a state of consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing that people are so capable of getting the war .
durkheim believed that everything we &apos;ve lived , seems to be a seemingly , seemingly .
he kept saying that &quot; the &quot; aw and &quot; people are not going to be together and cannot be addressed without immunized . &quot;
he uses the other .
once you were all in a same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about connecting to other people to adapt ethical ideas .
jh : thank you very much .
quickly , i realized that master &apos;s not just in the inside .
and right next to the garage , he has his own personal , where he can be in his own environmental stars , which is a more important role in the brain .
everything is easier to get in design , and here &apos;s this kind of thing that &apos;s going on , and , my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of print &quot; is now going to printed the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; -- it &apos;s another word for quotes .
this is actually an experiment for a client , and it &apos;s a set of people that we made a sequence of six photos and tried to get people to get the print on the internet .
they said that people didn &apos;t like them .
a paper about brian &apos;s book -- a really boring article -- so i put all the articles in the field of music .
somebody told me today , there were these things that the folder called , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
that &apos;s a lot of professions quite high .
before that , there was obviously , obviously , no technique . but obviously .
this is not another planet . these are things that are hidden on our planet .
and finally , i come back to this sort of thing .
this is a little bit of the street , he was with stephen jay gould &apos;s theory of the book .
we &apos;ve heard of the world &apos;s disease , the guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the invention of the technology -- what would be a loss of a loss of society .
octopus of photography , for the first time , when i was very young .
he reaches again , takes a arm full of gravel , and it &apos;s going to go ... &quot; aw , &quot; the same thing is , &quot; -- the same thing happens .
but the point is , we were there for a month , and i wanted to get the animals to get used to us , so that we could see their behaviors without getting them to care .
and if you go down , the lovely blue water , which you &apos;ve got to start with starts to start and forth , and you &apos;re going to be able to get more and more and more and more and more powerful .
but there &apos;s no sun down there , there &apos;s no photosynthesis . it &apos;s a world that &apos;s going on down there , it &apos;s all that volatile .
but fortunately , i &apos;ve seen the exact opposite .
everybody talks with each other . then it &apos;s not isolated points on a map , then it &apos;s a network that we have created .
she was a annie , and she didn &apos;t go to us and i went to the front of the baby , and she didn &apos;t buy me pink clothes , but he knew , he knew , he knew , he knew .

the heartbeat reduces , they live longer , and it &apos;s going to be the surface of the membrane and nutrients through the membranes , etc .
