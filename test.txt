you know , one of the great , big amounts of work , and one of the pleasures in the field of research is to live with people who remember the old days . they still feel the wind in the wind , they &apos;re going to taste rocks , they &apos;re going to taste the pirate sheets of the plants .
just knowing that the idea of the way that the idea of the way that the myth is still beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the oldest of the inuit is still , or the the shortest of the shoe is going to be the shortest , the idea of a group of mutual adaptation , which is the idea that the world is in which we have , in fact , a whole sense of view , but it &apos;s just a model of reality .
and of course we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re going to be born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the field of water .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation through death and so that we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dance and create art .
but interesting is the unique optimal loop of the design , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most powerful in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the most violent of the world , or a more , the warrior in the highlands , or a more , the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m traveling in a month in the desert , everest , the mother goddess of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other kinds of other people thinking , other ways to make sense of the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , you can only fulfill a hope .
together , the vast cultures of the world are a net of a grid of dna and cultural life that &apos;s going to be the earth and for the earth as important as the biological growth system that you know is the biological growth system .
you can imagine this cultural design model as a design model , and it can be considered the most powerful of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been made by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the most powerful legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re capable of and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species of species .
and as much as the biosphere was very windy , this was happening with the most powerful -- just even greater speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of things are gone from extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most powerful thing that we &apos;re looking at is the most common thing to the cultural diversity .
and the key judge is extinction of the languages .
when everybody was born in this room , we were talking to 6,000 languages in the world .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of plastic types .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that &apos;s a soul that &apos;s going to be found with a particular culture of the material .
every language is like a forest forest of the mind , a point of view , a thought , a very spiritual way of being spiritual .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the people are not going to be able to be more of the children in the ears .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught for infants . that means if nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely when the silence of being used to be a one of the last your people who are talking to your language , not to have a way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or hope to expect to expect the ability to be ?
and yet , there &apos;s a terrible destiny of this terrible destiny , in fact , about two weeks , because all two weeks , every two weeks , a elderly dies , and takes the last runway of a old language with a grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; would not be the world , if we all talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a storyteller that &apos;s a storyteller . &quot;
let &apos;s be aria . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a way today , and i &apos;m going to take you through a journey of the ted system , a short journey through the most violent , to try to make sure what &apos;s lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i &apos;m saying , &quot; different possibilities of the his , &quot; really different possibilities of his mine .
for example , take this kid of the world &apos;s oil , the 21st of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s population , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most prolific of the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because the forest of the forest , which is the people depend on the forest , the people are dependent on .
they have a strange language , and a linguistic language called the linguistic language , you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this is going to increase in the mythological past , which is curious to these big houses , where the most of the time of the world &apos;s population is spoken , but in the middle of the six or seven languages , you &apos;re never listening to someone who learns a language .
they just hear and then speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing of ecuador in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people who was first attacked by july , peaceful teszler .
in 1957 , five commandments were going to contact and made a mistake of a mistake .
they took up photographs of the air , which we would be more sensitive to as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people were never seen anything about the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and the character , and they were killing the girl &apos;s work , and killed the five commandments with the spear .
but the most successful , not only killed the spear .
they &apos;re going to be involved in each other .
54 percent of deaths happened by the sex rate .
we followed the top eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we put people with hyperscore , they gave them that one of the people has become so old that he died because of his age and we killed him .
but at the same time , they had a clear clue of forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a single 40 steps away , and determine what species of these were in this particular part .
in the early days of years , i got a really amazing task when my professor approached harvard , whether i was interested in walking to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the power and the secret of the strength that was used to make sure to make sure .
to give this spirit to a sense of , of course , i had to think about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable faith of the world &apos;s imagination and voodoo is not a civil war of the black magic .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world of the world &apos;s great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism or whatever .
a continent is going to leave , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , of course , and , of course , it &apos;s just the little of this very profound religious thought that &apos;s been the tragic of the great religious thought of the world &apos;s population .
but what was interesting is that this is a living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living parts of the mind .
the minds can be taken from under the large water , answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of living to the living , so that the most powerful for a brief moment is to god .
so , the most popular thing is , the most popular thing is , &quot; your white white is going to the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and will be god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with that , you &apos;re taken from the mind . how can you make damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the red demonstrations in a computer , the red coal without burning , an amazing illustration of the ability to influence the body that this is the same thing that it &apos;s going to be doing in an extreme aggressive state .
now , from all people i met , the kogi from sierra nevada de santa 1979 in the u.k. nevada , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civil civilization , the caribbean , the caribbean &apos;s center of colombia , and in the course of the crater , this people in a central form of the railroad , which is rising in a central place of the world .
in a corporate continent , these people were the only ones who never had been covered by the most violent .
until today , you &apos;re going to run from a ritual priesthood , and the education of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in age three and four years of their families , and in a deep world of darkness , in the middle of the glacier , to 18 years of , to be able to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , they &apos;re going to be elected to the very big mother of the pregnant mother , they spend a lot of time in the face of the great mother .
and as this whole time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say , the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll suddenly take a little bit out of the end and the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , the first light is going to be the way that you &apos;ve been experiencing the idea .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either have a little bit of a pain and the old peculiar of the fancy wild , which is a thought of the thought that is a thought of the thought , or the other , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , indigenous are neither a fan , they &apos;re not going to be a vegetarian .
it doesn &apos;t remain a lot of space in the world &apos;s position of life , or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , through time and ritual a mystery of the earth , it &apos;s shaped by the time , which is not being able to be aware of the earth , because it &apos;s going to be conscious in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andean , the most of the life that is a mountain , which is a mountain , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to that resource , is that a mountain can be a bunch of rocks , which can be washed up .
if he &apos;s a peanut , or a pile of sugar , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a more powerful .
that made me a different person when my friends were under the most violent , believing that these forests of the testes and the curved spirits are , the most prolific and the brain spirits , the most prolific , the people who are going to live in their own business .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a little bit of a sudden , from many of you , the most powerful logic of the repertoire of the repertoire of the human repertoire .
what makes the most intriguing thing is not just the most powerful potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually made of it . it &apos;s made of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden , which is a series of blood , which is a little bit of a blood of the family , which is the name of a car of the family , which is the name of a car of the family , which is a little bit of a blood &apos;s mouth .
these plant contains some very strong , very strong , which is the serotonin , and the brain &apos;s very similar way .
if you &apos;ve seen the most powerful , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you &apos;ve made of different kinds of things also .
this powder is about the way to get shot from a design of a film , and the hidden image of the sun , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create any bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan , who was the man who showed the most popular of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to be able to experience this kind of thing as a hallucination , because in the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not going to be able to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about the brain is that they can &apos;t be taken in , because they &apos;re not going to be able to be in the human gut , of course , in the human gut , of course , to be called the name of the name .
you can only put it into connection with some other chemicals that are the mao , the mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing thing that contains in the brain &apos;s population are the same , the way that it &apos;s necessary to get the power of the world , so ask yourself .
how can these people from an agricultural country of 80,000 species are not finding these two types of food , which is not related to these two types of plants that are in the way that the whole of the parts is , is that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which apparently turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most powerful , have 17 varieties of water that you all see in a big distance in the forest that seems to be a way of being a way .
and then you ask them how to build their own and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every one of the 17 varieties of dna and you &apos;re singing in a different set of different forms .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting a little bit more interesting .
now , the problem is that even the most difficult thing that you have to do is to have the kind of the best possible to do the native of native americans , but you &apos;re looking at the past , but you &apos;re kind of on the past , as the real world , is the fact that our world , is the most extension world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , and you &apos;re not going to remember the wars of a technical innovation , but rather than a period where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or more passive .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new zealand .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most popular hearing didn &apos;t hear less to sioux than they were leaving and arrow of tasks as the americans stopped being , when they stopped the horse and the other .
not change and technology refers to the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity ; it &apos;s power . ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you go in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the doom . these are dynamic living peoples that are being able to be locked up through the capacity of adaptation , and that &apos;s where they &apos;re going to be able to fill in the world , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most violent extinction of people &apos;s living , but the most violent , the destruction of the human beings , will not only be convicted , but generally , and more , and they &apos;re in general , and they &apos;re in general and a part of a health system .
and you can &apos;t understand the grammar of tibet if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground level .
i traveled to a young colleagues of the introvert miles of the amateur , in the galapagos of the galapagos , and i was looking at the face of the street behind the galapagos , and i was seeing the face behind the statistics of the statistics that were killed by the most violent and an ashes . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young baby was identified as an followers of the original lama .
that meant he was killing the chinese invasion .
his uncle fails with her holiness , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment was for -- for crimes .
he was driven by two years in prison to hide under their own , and they could not live with him without life .
the sister who was doing this brave did was brought into a school scanner .
one day she came out of a set of people on a set of people , and they had to have this kind of thing for seven years in a tough labor market .
the suffering of the berlin can be testable , but the most powerful mind of people is something more nuanced .
and at the end , we &apos;re really going to be a choice . do we want to live in a world &apos;s world of the world &apos;s flu or in a world of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity ?
margaret mandelbrot , the great anthropologist , before she died that it &apos;s the greatest fear that we &apos;re moving towards a needle , and we &apos;re going to move , and we &apos;re going to wake up , and we &apos;ll wake up with a dream of the human imagination , and we &apos;ve forgotten one day , and we &apos;ve just wake up in a dream .
and it &apos;s a humbling to think that our species may exist since 600,000 years .
the main revolution that brought us the agriculture and we &apos;re in this moment of the marine union , which translated poetry from the delivery of the world through the prose of the priesthood , and the hierarchy of the surplus -- found a decade ago , just 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these myriad types of information to the meaning of human questions , you know about 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to hire the possibility to be what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be thriving , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the top of the street , and this man , the baby , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most of the time in the world &apos;s population , they were forced to pull in neighborhoods .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have a fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the most of their sled were originally made of fish that were thrown in in a refugee &apos;s hospital .
the man &apos;s husband didn &apos;t fear the arctic night , or the shooting storm .
he went out to the outside , he made his pants out of the street , and he &apos;s got his hand in his hand , and when the feces began to market , he formed it in the form of a single one .
he was hanging out the pages of the mountain of the mountain and it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he was making the dog and screaming a given , took the skeleton of the dog and knitting a ride , sat on the front of the dog and the back of the street with the water on the outskirts of the stadium .
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit , and all native americans on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called a problem .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling the whole lot of the water .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the people , can look for his people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most powerful of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination , go back to the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the hope of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact is that the fact that we think that the world is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website will get 35 million more than every month .
gh nations send our transportation team .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we have a series of trips to the most of the trips that we &apos;re taking to places like this cultural wonder that they were blinded by the things that are made of the things that we can do , and hopefully , they will be able to find a more vivid revelation of the world &apos;s own well-being , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first can tell you about , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re doing microsoft as part of a year ago , and it &apos;s a very , very big , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either deal with local or distant data .
we see a lot of people here , many of the things that you can see in digital photographs , which you can see , and you can see , the bailout , the guards , can lead to any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library , and it &apos;s a scan of a library of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be driven is that the number of digital markers can be a number of times in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design .
this is a house house from glenn . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one is real representation of the design and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more , a more unfair .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a kind of a , case , this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a piece .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper to read a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place to the screen .
we hope that this is not a builder and other nonsense , which is that it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m really not going to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s picture is the nasa .
now let &apos;s get a little bit out of it .
now , this is even live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies combined .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the noah who of the noah , who of the university of washington , in the university of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft &apos;s research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view , where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of post-traumatic resolution .
but the spatial framework of images is actually in the matter of meaning .
the most popular ones have taken these pictures together , and they put the real space in which these images that were all done near the surface of the coast of the canadian , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re going to be given the elements of the slides , or they &apos;re all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got to show you other environments .
there are what we have , which is a lot of concentration .
i &apos;d like to show you straight to one of the original data sets of weekends , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the past that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline that we have on the website . and that &apos;s not necessarily the way you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers as many as we were .
this is a reconstruction of voodoo dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , just give you the ace of flickr &apos;s lady in flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts , and they &apos;ll get a picture of the picture that was discovered as this model .
so this is all the most sophisticated , and they &apos;re all in the way that they &apos;re in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception right here .
i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : everything is in the way that the standard of the world is to professional professional services , a pretty large number of them , which were all going to be in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of johannes dame , which was really recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and now it &apos;s data from all collected -- from the whole collective memory of how , as opposed to the earth -- and everything will connect each other .
all these photos are going to be connected and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen kamen on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s going to use through the complexity , which is the people using it , and it &apos;s going to use it for the user using the application .
their own photos are going to be covered with airbnb who have another person .
if someone has done the hard job , and all of these sacred people have been labeled , and who they &apos;re all told , then my photo will suddenly fit with the emperor of the emperor of the data , and i can use it as a start to take the pictures of the other piece of social experience .
and of course , byproduct all of this are the immense rich models of each interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through the surface of the earth , and that &apos;s not just by the collective storage , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to have a specific at a certain time in the next years , all the images that are used by someone in the world , in principle , in common ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover .
if you want to build them , they &apos;re in the face of the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of information that you have , which have many of these images .
as if you do a computer company for pictures , where you &apos;re building sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that &apos;s the picture .
but how would it be , if the image you connected to all of your pictures ?
then the scope of the brain is the amount of space , and the abundance that make it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope , in unison with other things , are you already hearing . and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; official .
the official of what ?
the official of all western societies in the industrialized industrialized societies .
the official business system works like this : if our goal is to maximize the public &apos;s public , it &apos;s all about the freedom of freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , meaningful , a sense of human desire for human .
if people have freedom , everybody is about us to do things for themselves , to do the things that our common lives and not to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not come to the sense of question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress is about .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to say something about the talk about a little bit about the story .
there &apos;s an average world in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t have the 10 different extra extra extra extra extra extra , and 12 times you could buy it to make a big number of their own wounds , in which unlikely case , that no one &apos;s the british war in the store for you .
so this is how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business business business to put a stereo -- speakers , a computer , a radio , radio , radio , the vitality , and in this one electronics , there are so many regular facilities .
we can put together millions of different regular plants in the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any phone , you &apos;d have to have a phone , as long as he came from derek bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one of the things that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the middle of the street , and preferably , and preferably , and preferably recyclable sari .
and you should not have seen that in your business now , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it makes people run into the business and asking that question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very important than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a power or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the burden of responsibility for someone who knows something of something -- the patient &apos;s -- -- -- -- -- the patient &apos;s -- to someone who &apos;s not in the best constitution -- mostly the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and i , if they &apos;re thinking about it , not to make sense of it because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor at the next morning and ask a change to ask .
something so profound about our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinvent how we want .
that means that every day you wake up the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most human was that almost every one had one and that they got married as quickly as they could , and then they got them as fast as they could .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or do i do a career ? &quot;
these are all the questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and not good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every place on the planet -- until the most prolific hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most powerful thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can see our children playing with football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our blackberry is probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re in our child , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i be able to put this call ? &quot;
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the baby &apos;s child , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in that we were living was so out .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of making it happen , is that he &apos;s going to make it happen .
so , with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more sophisticated example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the comic of the plastic , the giant plastic of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 of the 10 times that the employer were offered the employer , the participation around two percent .
they provide 50 percent of them -- 10 percent less employees than if they only provide five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more basic ones that are the choice to get to the choice , it &apos;s so hard to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never comes .
you know , that that &apos;s not just that people had to eat when they were going to go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the back , it means that they &apos;re going to miss the decisions that they &apos;re missing .
and they &apos;re not participation by the age of 5,000 , a year of the most successful , who would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to make the world look like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the great choice of different kinds of information , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s just perfect , it &apos;s just a different decision to make that you have the decision , and what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s going to be a different decision to make it regret , and what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s going to be a more decision that &apos;s been made of the choice .
the more possibilities there are , the simpler it doesn &apos;t really have to regret the choice that they meet .
second , what economists call the military revolution .
dan gilbert has made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we &apos;re comparing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s just attractive to imagine the underlying properties that they are doing , which makes them feel less happy with the alternatives that they have chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the of you , that &apos;s not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive deep property .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my inbox is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility of the possibility , day , a great parking lot .
and the happiness rate is lower enough to get the happiness we &apos;ve got , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities that we have to make the choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take place .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few people .
he &apos;s going to be a statement about living in the right now and maybe doing things slowly .
but a key point he &apos;s doing is , always who you &apos;re deciding for a thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third , the expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i was practicing my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it was just jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad sex , they were incredibly reactive and they were often covered enough enough and they &apos;ve been carrying enough enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the officer said , &quot; do you want a smooth , easy or a big ?
do you want buttons or half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , you know , in fact , blah blah , blah -- &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that i used to have the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans , and the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it to explain it .
the reason i felt worse was that i felt bad with all these options , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it was in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , it would have been perfect to have a perfect one .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i expected , and what i had was the expected thing to do in comparison to what i expected .
the alternative of human beings is inevitably increasing the expectations of people who have the people who have been going to be about how good these choices are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you know what it is like here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that it was all better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything bad was to make people experience a pleasant surprise .
today in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can ever hope is so good as you would expect .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are great .
the secret to the main system -- that &apos;s what they all came from -- the secret to the internet of the world are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment of time -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but shut is not always a bad thing .
finally , one of the most powerful people sitting in a bad room , when there &apos;s only one kind of purchase , if you &apos;re a little bit of a break , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the answer is , what would you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying one of the rainy , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people are making decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they &apos;re going to be disappointed .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant evolutionary model of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to explain their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s all more , an objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official business of that that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices than something more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to make our common lives .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule , the thing that is about thinking about it . what all these choices allow in the industrialized societies is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not to be the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry : steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decision -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that , we &apos;re getting worse .
if something of what people do in our society are making decisions to the societies in people who have been able to make people move to people , not only would life improve , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a drug application .
so , the point is that it &apos;s going to be all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are all the way that we do all the way .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a very disruptive person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , you know , it &apos;s not possible in this kind of rock . &quot;
gifted imagination , a more powerful view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to see the fish that the fish know .
because the truth is that if you break the internet , it &apos;s so much possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the water , it &apos;s so much possible , it &apos;s going to reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a more powerful .
this is almost limited to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing about a metaphor of a metaphor of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , i think , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think i think is a lot of biologists trying to understand and that on different levels .
we tried to make different approaches to it to simplify the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the most prolific , the change of the analog world of biology is the digital world of biology .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate life or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that has to replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our mind , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all these genes we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to be able to do that .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome down ?
does it really allow chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start that chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material , by the way .
our steps in the fluorescence of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but yet , our final point would be on an exponential curve now .
we started about 15 years ago .
it took a few years of starting to work with a research review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a piece of a process that makes a piece of the piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way of building these little pieces that we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus killing the bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a mistake error and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of dna , and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then were released by the cells and then they went back and killed back to e. coli .
i talked about oil oil , and they said they were trying to understand this model .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that &apos;s a situation in the software actually can build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build a whole universal chromosome , and it &apos;s more than a black letter of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in tapes of the size of the virus , which we could vary the size of the kind of tomato tissue to understand what the individual components are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we showed the genome at 1995 , the most violent thing was a mistake per 10,000 base base .
we found out the most successful 30 mistakes , if we had used the original sequence , it never had been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces of letters for 50 letters , and that &apos;s where you have to have a different amount of time to build smaller amounts of water to build smaller amounts of water .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the wild .
think about it : we have a network of code : a , c , g , g and t.
so , the letters of this letter -- this letter opens about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just easily divide them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and then gather it back .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five to the five of the letters , to put these together together to make these together , to try to restore these together , to the more sophisticated .
in every step , we have produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of the food system .
so , this looks like a computer &apos;s game .
if we get to these right big pieces -- with 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to be just growing in e. to the rest of the modern molecular molecular and so we used to connect other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the brain system that was used to repair biology to repair dna that can bring pieces of these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the carbon , the three million rads of radiation in radiation .
you see the top field that its chromosome is just apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has put together like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even be in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and moving to aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a key of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using it to have a very basic design of the pieces of the pieces we have , and we put it on , yeast adds this one together .
this is not a regular , regular blood game .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the internet system .
these are footage about a $ 6 hour .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve done recently .
these are about the most striking letters of the brain , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with a structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a more powerful of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a 10 and without distances of 10 and without distances , it would include the pages of the genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in the same way that we &apos;re going to do it , you just take the nucleus out and give you another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about the clone .
in the computer of the brain , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we showed that you can actually transplant a full transplant of a triangle to another and that can activate them .
we &apos;ve been displaced the chromosome of a carbon . roughly , these two things are like humans and mice . we gave a few of them to destroy the chromosome . we &apos;re going to put it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing to us , and it &apos;s really amazing to us .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end , but we tried to get the process to a little bit .
this is the most powerful of evolution here .
we &apos;re all finding species here , which have taken a second chromosome , or a third of the world &apos;s two , every time thousands of photos in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is being changed at a time , missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the most primitive , which actually is called dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added already .
it was in the cell , and it was found the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we had a cell , and so we had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue thing that we had added to the genes .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and it completely converted into a new species of new zealand that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have running running away .
it may sound like genomic design , but we can , by changing the world &apos;s data , changes quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the most powerful -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new organizational explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years , and we &apos;re in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in the year .
today , three people in this planet are in 1946 for each of the year in 2100 , within 40 years , and in the age of 40 , it &apos;s been done .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , and we have a fresh water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , solar dioxide billion barrels of oil , and these are a hundred million drums per day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is all the co2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most powerful of the future .
the main one had a dozen components and you see the diversity that came from that .
we &apos;re going to be able to be in the first line of the biological reality and the idea of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this rapid , which we call the most of the things that we call genetics .
we have now the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to get food or drugs , we can change with a little team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just more inclusive selection , and we can go to the metal of plastic , production of chemicals or the other , and so on .
this is a shot of actual gas that we &apos;re working on , which is actually to sit down and design new species .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it , we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn farms recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the fuel and third generation that will come out relatively soon , the much higher levels of energy , how reduce food or different kinds of information .
but , as we think the only way of thinking about biology is a big impact without any other increase on food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a source of co2 , and therefore we work on cells that go to this path .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different kinds of ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a living mile , in almost a little bit of time , almost more than a lot of time .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could be just to be brought to the carbon dioxide , and they convert co2 to the fuel , to make this process .
in a short time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- we have -- the kind of goals like the substitute of the entire drip industry . right . if you could do that at ted , where else ?
but we &apos;re working on the same time that we &apos;re using these same approaches to the development of vaccines .
they saw it with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and a dollar to make a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by being able to create vaccines in the field of the field .
this is how the future might look like , with changes , can be accelerated today , and now , synthetic bacteria , and perhaps the most powerful .
we &apos;re moved light from people from that to better than we are , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who didn &apos;t exist there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second one in the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these online centers in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the wide , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
the 10th of september last year was the machine for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s made huge amounts of water in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first , which is the entire route to put the lhc , then to be part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine is working , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest largest , or this , as someone who was visiting the google page and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- this golden wires here .
these wires run the same , when the machine runs on the surface of the street .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford to do that because if you &apos;re very cool , you &apos;ll be called the so-called carbon dioxide .
so , minus pisa , as the space between the stars , these wires can be able to adjust tension .
in one of the connections , between the surface of the triangle , there was a plastic set of ink .
so , it &apos;s suddenly heating the wires , and they suddenly have more resistant resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is wonderful if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and it &apos;s turning around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , they &apos;re called .
they &apos;re all back to their way back to their way .
the lhc was going to be viable again .
we &apos;ll turn it down , and we &apos;ll expect the first data in june or july to collect our journey , and we &apos;ll go to the journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way of copying accidents , again , the debate of science and engineering at the borders of science , it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we are going beyond our limitations , is the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words , a english scientist , which is , i think , as i suspect when he &apos;s the most violent experiments of his life &apos;s worth , his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , when assume that our scientific ideas are in nature , that our scientific ideas are not in nature , that our scientific beliefs are in nature .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but the recent thing is a recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to me that i have a complete idea to rethink my relationship .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called the &quot; a biography , &quot; and love , love , love -- that decided to get out of some of my previous books in the world and a big , international , international , international , international power system .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated as if i &apos;m going to be the fall of the fall .
seriously -- the equator of the fall !
for example , you &apos;re going to get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never will ever be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to have your whole life , and never again create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i was a teenager to be a teenager , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of thing that i had had the same kind of thing .
people said , &quot; did you have no fear , never succeed ? &quot;
did you not fear the humiliation of a letter ?
you don &apos;t have a fear that you &apos;re going to take your life for your life and never get something out there and that you &apos;re going to die on a football accident -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer to all these questions is : the short answer to all of these questions is : yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m more afraid of fear that nobody would be a burden of .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i think about it for recently and question , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that by someone who should be expected to do that , the work that he feels really is being informed ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise that they &apos;re encouraged us to do about the related state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years than he asked if he was scared to be chemist .
with your favorite company , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not come to the african press , people who have been receiving the reputation of the internet .
we seem to have a writer that we have , but not only the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative allen , they seem to have to be mentally unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter of the really great head of really great minds of the 20th century , the young and often died of your own hand .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually have been able to do that , actually seemed to be charged by their talents , really neglected by their talents .
norman mandelbrot said a little bit before his death in his last interview : in my last interview , i had a little bit of killing myself .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life work .
but we didn &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements since so long ago . somehow we have the notion of that as long as we have , and that art is kind of engaging , and that art -- the end of the -- always leads to the most important .
the question i want to ask you today is : is this idea of it all right ?
you feel like this ? because with only one centimeter distance -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion of thinking .
i think they &apos;re all the way .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative endeavor .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , this dark path of the meaning of the kind of thing that i &apos;m in my career is , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more popular school .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to talk about now is the world &apos;s work as the work that &apos;s been made for the success of my last book , right ?
i say it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here , and it &apos;s really likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning , drink gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most powerful , i seem to be able to write to write , a kind of a kind of a kind of a random psychological kind of psychological thing .
somehow i have to find out of a way to get a sense of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural , and i think about how the reaction is going to be on writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the last year to do this , i also went to find out the past and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more of the ideas that are related to creativity .
this quest to take me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will come back again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of meritocratic , a kind of a meritocratic , unknown source to people coming from a distant , unknown source .
the greeks were calling these divine folk voices of creativity to creativity .
by socrates , he believed that he believed he had a baby who had to come from the distance to him .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of kind of creative creative mind , a genius of creative mind .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic unacceptable creature , which was that it was literally in the walls of a football -- about the way that the most powerful and the artists were doing the work of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s it , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the following of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in a little bit of a sense , like , for example , too much bribe , right ?
if you were brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you for a hundred year-old , and everybody knew you had this kind of a genius that helped you .
if your work is going to be , not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew her genius was something paralyzed .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and all changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no more to the mystic creatures that are going to take orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational fertilization and people started thinking that creativity was completely from individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call this or the artists , and they call a genius , instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a naked person , that he thinks he or it &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the the source of all the divine and the most honest and the source of all the divine , the human psyche , is a little bit too much responsibility to make a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
and the ticking and a distorted whole egos and it creates all of these daycare expectations of success .
i think that this is the most powerful thing that we &apos;ve been attracted to the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate the growth of 500 years of rational fertilization in a very much of a second talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would say , really , really , really , really , really , really , the scientific scientific doubt , which is , basically -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the people who are doing success and they &apos;re using their projects on their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it &apos;s the same sense that it &apos;s just as much sense of everything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about the absolute crazy of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s going to be -- like everyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words : in other words , everybody here -- not always compassion .
in fact , he can feel really natural .
i had a way to hit the same kind of the extraordinary poet poet , which is now about 90 , but she was a whole life for the long poet , and she told me that she was growing up in the middle of virginia , she said she would feel and hear how a poem is about the landscape of the landscape .
she would be like a train train from air .
the country would be on the land .
she felt , because it would come , because it would bring the earth under the earthquake .
she knew that she was able to do one of these times in a moment , and that was -- in her words -- the heck of the devil , the heck of the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking from this poem , and it was just that she was fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen that had to get it when it was wrapped up by the shortcut , catching and on the sheet .
in other words , she didn &apos;t get fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran the house , and she didn &apos;t get the house and i didn &apos;t give it to the house , and she would say -- it would go to the country , and i would say -- he would go to a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments where they were almost missed it .
so , she goes to the house and looking for paper and the poem through her and she &apos;s getting a pen just as it &apos;s made by them and then -- she said -- it was like this with her other hand and getting it to get it .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into your body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the opportunity that the poem came up with , and it &apos;s intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i was very fond of this -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to be .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a training professor . i have to get up to the same time , and i have to sweat every day , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable with it , really awkward .
but even i have a little more reflective thing sometimes in my college lab .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me that i really don &apos;t really identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we deal with losing our minds with our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to do this , the musicians tom &apos;s ability to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist who tried to master these miniature creative impulses that lived in his day , and they &apos;re working with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a dent in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he went with high speed than he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is how it &apos;s often been a lot of a difficult effect , and he wants to have it . he &apos;s going to be able to hold it . he can &apos;t put it in .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts , this old thing in him , and he &apos;s going to go back like this , like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get to be applied by this song forever . &quot;
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just heard .
he ended up the whole meeting and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
so , i think of the way i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of a moment when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else is going to be .
go and roll cohen cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as the same as ever as it was .
but the process and the heavy design system that surrounds him was to get out of where he was in trouble , where he was not going to be in trouble and he got out where he was in the way that he was in a way that he had no idea of the , no matter .
it could give a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , brilliant thing that was not tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it has been saved by me .
this idea of me as i was in the middle of the street of the street , the u.s. war , was the love of the failure , and i fell into one of these threads that we all fall when we work on something and not work . you &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to get the project out of it .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried to do it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i spoke to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i was talking about it , and i &apos;m talking , you know , you , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m going to invest everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your proportion .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you know , the hell .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a report that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries of people have been exposed to the desert in the deserts of the world , and they &apos;ve gathered out to be a lot of the people who were left for hours -- until dawn .
these strong were great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually got a huge way of doing .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this performance in your life once .
it was as if the time was going to be the time and the dancer through a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic form , and he did nothing else than he ever did -- 1,000 nights before , but all added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t get in human history .
he was lit up by the inside and down and down and everything that was a unacceptable fire .
as something that happened then , people knew what was that . they called it his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : the shah , jagger , allah , , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical of the world , when the u.s. boomers came out of the road , they had this practice with the centuries of the world , the aurochs changed over the centuries of the marine hybridization , belshazzar , manipulative , the biotech , which is still the most powerful and more friendly , and he sounds like that .
if a performer in spain is doing something impossible , something magical did : the biotech mentality , the brain , the brain , the brain , the great , educated , amazing , educated , educated , and it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancers wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more a joint of god in himself .
he &apos;s just an aging knee with a blood attack , and maybe he will never again go back to those heights .
and maybe someone will never call up the name of god , but what &apos;s going to be like , what about the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most powerful numerical views of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite like whiskey , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of them were .
if you may just think that you &apos;re a bribe -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , that &apos;s passed on someone else , when you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , it changes all .
so i started thinking and i think i think about security in the past few months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of -- when dangerous , scary , strong , the expected , very expected , the expected , very expected , the expected , very expected , my favorite thing .
what i &apos;ve got to say constantly , if i &apos;m going to get crazy , is not fear .
not a clue .
do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius , that you get to the side , you decide to be a little bit of a sudden of wonder through your effort , then the more powerful thing about your effort .
and if not , dance still your dance .
and the most powerful thing about you , despite all of you .
i think it &apos;s a feeling , and i feel that we should teach .
and the most powerful thing about it is , despite you , just for you , just for you , you just have a human love and the most powerful , for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
the question .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic state of the arctic , which had almost three million years of the size of the lower 48 states , has wiped out 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic state is the gateway heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and it &apos;s freezing in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a little bit of a research of what happened in the last 25 years .
the most powerful is with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s kind of determined to do the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s drifting in summer .
this so-called the so-called , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to put the arctic ocean into the arctic ocean , which is if you have a lot of carbon dioxide , which is when it &apos;s going to be done , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of time , compared to the whole amount of time , it could double this amount , if we cross this critical point .
now , in some flat lakes today in alaska , in some flat lakes of itself .
professor merchant walter &apos;s university in alaska , with another new sea , traveled to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it tell us the other person .
and one reason is , this enormous heat blows out of the north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most powerful river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level goes up through the surface of the world , you will go into the ocean .
these rivers take a rapid basis .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest design system on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative fuel rate .
and the most important thing that showed you about a few of the things is particularly central in the melt forest .
this is 20 feet deep , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most powerful , the sun &apos;s new lakes , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their family &apos;s disease .
in the andean , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most prolific ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get out of the water , most of the water is dropped .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra union was seen .
this is beyond the most violent .
and the predictions , as they read they are , are serious .
this is a dramatic increase in the entire world to fire a dramatic increase .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have never been an unprecedented and unprecedented degree of the world .
four times in the last 30 years like the most respected spasm .
this is a completely valid of the brain .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours of co2 every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , the american continent , and in the united states , where there is a universal decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor of global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most peaceful problem .
the united states is one of the largest largest oil systems , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more of the other more sophisticated .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were thrown in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
so , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most powerful and the most violent one has spent a dollar dollar last last day to provide clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
at christmas , at christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of carbon .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s land of america .
this happened to be christmas .
one of the commercials of the world &apos;s favorite thing was that .
the most violent thing is a very , happy guy .
there &apos;s a lot of it in the skin and abundance of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
the most powerful , the most powerful one is going to be clean .
it &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s more affordable , and workers stay in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful most powerful thing is the leader of the internet &apos;s book .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy mandelbrot , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has started to live in life .
this is one of them , part of them .
and in the most violent , climate change , we see climate change as a serious danger .
so we put it on the top of the day , to spend a significant economic policy to bring a more significant one to get the truth on the road , to the truth .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave you with that .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean piano system .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal is the most important for global warming , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it precisely , this is the right today , clean water .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security system .
america is in crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects this together is our dependence from the fuel of the fuel as dirty coal and the dirty oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us look out of this kind of thing .
the u.s. is new percent of the clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough is to solve our problems .
the u.s. &apos;s new american , find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a military of america .
one of the fastest ways that our dependence from old , dirty fuels , which are bound to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good money better .
the u.s. &apos;s americas is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to get the time of your childhood , when you played with a computer game .
while they realized how to remove the hands and make the sound , the most powerful and move , they actually learned to think and make problems through understanding and change the relationship and change the relationship and change the connections .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my favorite computer , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we were using computers , which is a digital health system , which is a digital health system , which is , what if we could make it , and how do we want to make it ?
this question was so empowering that we decided to study the answer and developed the solution .
and shortly , a computer designer is a very interactive computer in the size of a football system .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a brick .
much more importantly : are are physically , why you can only get it out of your hands and access it to your hands .
and the most important generation of a new generation of design is a new generation of data to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are becoming physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , they can see each other and the edges of our brain systems with them , we can start to explore new and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most powerful thing for the most violent , and when i go to a direction , the video will go forward ; if i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them next to them , they make interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the people , you can notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their tendency .
one interesting episode of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color to make it like that , how to do it with fluid .
in this case , we have three main centers as a computer designer , and i can use it to assemble color into the middle of the middle where they &apos;re mixed up .
if we keep it on , we can make a little bit more of a space .
there are also some nice ways of doing this in education like languages , mathematics or corporate , where we give people the opportunity to get fast to try and see the results .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple kind of a little bit of a basic design .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of the and the brain .
basically , you get every round of every round of the cloud , and you &apos;re trying to form words , and you &apos;re going to be tested with a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , they become mixed and you have a new set of plastic and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who were on a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to it , try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest business of the bottom right there .
it turns out he was just going to stack up the world &apos;s test .
so for him , they were just a little bit more inclusive .
this is an interactive computer .
we wanted to develop a design system for the design system .
this is the amur ridge .
he can bring new characters in the scene by putting the back of the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to be the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange senator .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most prolific , and you can put them on side , and then put the characters on ...
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got today to show you , is a video of research for the game of a game that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the most violent than sound , as a sound , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence , which you can put in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to be able to do it by just putting a stick on a car .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a particular note and it &apos;s then to put it into the schedule .
and then even more accelerated effects like speed and volume that you can apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start in the world &apos;s most productive , and we &apos;re going to distribute these in a series of a series , extend it and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some drums .
and now i &apos;m going to pull the filter with the drums so i can steer the effect live .
i can speed the whole sequence by the way that i hit the speed of one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to pull the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them to do it in the front line , but it can make it improvise ; they &apos;re extending it or more .
and finally , i can choose all the sequence , by looking at the most dramatic to left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new design tools that can make better sense of how our brains and bodies work .
